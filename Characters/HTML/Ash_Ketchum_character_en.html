Ash is very determined to be a good <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">Pokemon trainer</sc_element>. He is a very strong man and shows a great love for <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element>, usually helping and making friends with the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element> that he meets on his long journey. As a result, he doesn't like <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">trainer</sc_element> who mistreat <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element>, such as Damian and Sheimus. He is also the clearest role model for many people, such as May, Dawn, En, Serena, Lily and Guo. In addition, Ash often amazes people with his skills and abilities. Ash's strategy in battle is to solve problems, including during special matches. In many episodes, Ash's tactics include solving problems with battle and everything related to the special <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_ability">abilities of Pokemon</sc_element>. In addition, Ash even receives information from his friends and this always helps him when he is lost in conjecture. Ash is usually kind, compassionate, brave, enthusiastic, passionate and adventurous, but at times can be stubborn, quick-tempered, impatient, impudent, impulsive and reckless. During his journey, Ash realized that some of these traits influenced him, as they made him lose some of his battles in the hymns. Recognizing this, Ash prepared himself for both rematch games and helped control these parts of himself so that they no longer appear. Although these traits still persist, it has been shown that they are a lesser problem in the battles of Ash <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element>. Thanks to his hard work, Ash corrected the hot, bold and impulsive parts of his personality, although he still shows them when the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element> is mistreated, when some of his friends tease him, and for various other reasons. Since then, Ash has shown much greater maturity and poise both in battles and outside of them. Ash is also interested in science and technology, although he cannot understand most of them.
