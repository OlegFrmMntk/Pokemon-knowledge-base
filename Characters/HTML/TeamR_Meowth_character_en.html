<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Sometimes Meowth can commit evil and cynical deeds, but deep down he always remains a cute heroic kitten. Meowt always remembers the good, always trying to thank the one who did something good to him. Once, when he was sick, he was cured by a girl, Cassandra. He repaid her by teaching her the Pokemon, Paras, to fight. He defended his beloved Meowshi to the last, despite the fact that she still considered him crazy. He pretended to be wild mutt to do something nice for the little boy for children's day. He fought for Jesse on Princess Day, helping her win a set of emperor dolls. Meowt loves Jesse and James and looks forward to finally getting married. It may seem to some that the purpose of Meowt's life is to become a higher cat again. Yes, he is jealous of Persian Giovanni, but he does it more out of habit, in fact, he will never leave his friends: he didnâ€™t leave them when he had a chance to become a living god on the island of Meow, because for Jesse and James Meow - always the highest cat. He is the luck of team P and its charm.
