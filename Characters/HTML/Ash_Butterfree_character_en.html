<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Being <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_caterpie">Caterpie</sc_element>, he has a very happy but shy attitude; it was shown that he suffers from low self-esteem if he did not make a good first impression; he was very hurt when Misty did not take him. He is also very brave, fighting against Pigeotto, and then the Pokémon of Team R alone.

Being a <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_methapod">Methapod</sc_element>, he was very laid-back, but remained faithful to his coach; this was shown when he jumped in front of Bidrill to save Ashe.

Being  <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_butterfree">Butterfree</sc_element>, his personality was similar to that of <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_caterpie">Caterpie</sc_element>, preserving his courage and positive orientation. But, as seen in the “Farewell Butterfree!” Series, his self-esteem still suffered when he did not make a good first impression.
