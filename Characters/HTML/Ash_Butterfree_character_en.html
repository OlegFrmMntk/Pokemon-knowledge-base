<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Being Caterpie, he has a very happy but shy attitude; it was shown that he suffers from low self-esteem if he did not make a good first impression; he was very hurt when Misty did not take him. He is also very brave, fighting against Pigeotto, and then the Pokémon of Team R alone.

Being a Methapod, he was very laid-back, but remained faithful to his coach; this was shown when he jumped in front of Bidrill to save Ashe.

Being Butterfree, his personality was similar to that of Caterpie, preserving his courage and positive orientation. But, as seen in the “Farewell Butterfree!” Series, his self-esteem still suffered when he did not make a good first impression.
