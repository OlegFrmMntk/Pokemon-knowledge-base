<h2>Appearance</h2>
Jassy is a thin and fairly tall 25-year-old woman. She has blue eyes and long purple hair. In this way, she wildly looks like Jessibelle, the bride of James. The entire first and subsequent seasons wears a white uniform: a short white shirt with the letter R, under which you can clearly see her belly button, white miniskirt, black gloves, black boots and round green earrings on the ears. Under the shirt is a black T-shirt, which is also located above the belly button. In the series BW001 - BW025 in the Best Wishes season, wears a black uniform and then wears a white one again. With 31 episodes of the 21st season in the Alola region, she began to wear a Z-ring in her hand with Mimicum Z.
