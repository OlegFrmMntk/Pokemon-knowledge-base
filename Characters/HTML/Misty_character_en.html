There are many episodes that were seen when Misty got along with other younger children in the family known as Mikey, Sakura and Max. This means that Misty understands their feelings that they are the youngest children. Misty has a small inferiority complex, mainly because of her three older sisters Daisy (older), Violet (second from older) and Lily (third from older), who formed the group “Three sensational sisters” (their synchronized swimming group) , and they call Misty "shorty" or "weakling." This complex decreases over time as Misty gets closer to them. Until Misty resumed her duties as the leader of the gyrim Tserulin, her sisters directly controlled the hymn, although when Ash came for his Cascade badge, it was Misty who fought for him, clearly calling herself one of them - the leaders of the time of this instance.
