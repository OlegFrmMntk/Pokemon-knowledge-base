<h1>Misty's Dewgong</h1>
Dewgong first appeared as a Seel in The Water Flowers of Cerulean City. It was most likely not used by Misty's sisters in battle because they claimed they had no battling Pok√©mon when Ash challenged them for a Badge. It held the Cascade Badge on its tongue in this episode.
