<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Jassy has a very complicated character. Sometimes you might think that she simply hates women. In fact, she simply can not stand those who are more talented or prettier than she. She also hates Misty, as she often receives compliments and calls her “sweet”, which is simply unbearable for Jesse. Like James, she is conceited, she just hates it when someone interrupts her, questions her views and destroys her ideals. She has a very high conceit, which is shown in her attempts to become a coordinator (she considers herself the best).
