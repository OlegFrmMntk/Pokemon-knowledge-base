<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Pidgeot was loyal and had an extremely strong relationship with Ash, the only one of his original six Pok√©mon that he had never had a bad relationship with before or after capture. He always followed his orders exactly, even when it led to a personal risk of self-destruction - to take on fear, Arbok Jessy and the ancient giant Gengar are just three examples. Brock once stated that Pigeotto would take any attack for Ash, and Misty lamented that Charizard was not as loyal as Pidgeotto.
