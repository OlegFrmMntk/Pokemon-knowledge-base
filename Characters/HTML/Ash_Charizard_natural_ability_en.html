<h2>Abilities</h2>
After many years of training in the Charisific Valley in the Joto region, Charizard became significantly stronger and tougher, featuring a much more ferocious flamethrower and knowledge of various new movements, such as Overheating, Dragon Breath, Slash and Dragon Tail. He defeated Sisor and Golem Gary in quick succession before finally defeating Blastoise, despite the advantage of the water type over the fire type. He also fought and defeated Artikuno Nolanda (one of the three legendary Pokemon birds in the Kanto region) while still training in the Charisifik Valley. As soon as he completed his training course, he returned to Ash for his journey to Yunova, where he easily defeated the pseudo-legendary Dragonite Iris; he did not receive visible damage from the Dragon Roll before crushing Dragonite with one powerful blow of the Dragon Tail. All these exploits prove that Charizard is indeed one of Ash's if not the strongest Pok√©mon, and that Ash would definitely have won a lot more battles if he had been used more often.
