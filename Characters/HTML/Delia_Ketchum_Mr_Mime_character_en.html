<h2>Chacarter</h2>
In the Ketchum household, Mimi is extremely responsible. He loves to do housework and refuses others to make his job easier. When Brock lived at Ash's house, he always wrestled with Miami over who should be in charge of the chores. He is also quite protective of the Ketchum home, for example, when Butch and Cassidy tried to destroy the garden, he did not hesitate to respond to their attack.

While fighting, Miimi established himself as a capable fighter, as is how he easily defeated Hariyama Hoji. When someone like Guo underestimates Mimi, he can appear smug. However, he is aware of his own limits and will not risk himself against type flaws as he quickly retreated after realizing that he had to confront Matiena Hoxha, against whom he held a lower hand.
