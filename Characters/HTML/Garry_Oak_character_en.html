In the initial seasons, Garry proved to be pretty good as a coach, but he let us down with character. Always tried to prove that he is better than Ash. And he did it, judging because Garry was one step ahead of the opponent. Later, already in subsequent seasons, Garry changed his character a little. He still wanted to win, but he could help Ash solve a problem. He became famous as a poet (Dawn loves his poetry).
