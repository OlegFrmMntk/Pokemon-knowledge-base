<h1>Ash's Primeape</h1>
Ash caught Primeape on Route 7 in Primeape Goes Bananas. After Ash learned that Gary had already caught 30 Pokémon, he aspired to catch more for himself. Soon afterward, a friendly wild Mankey ate some of Brock's food. Ash took this opportunity to try to catch the Pokémon, but the Poké Ball failed, instead catching a rice ball. Mankey was angered and chased the group, beat up Ash, and stole his hat.
