<h2>Biography</h2>
According to the novelization by Takeshi Shudo, she runs Pallet Town's only restaurant, Pallet House, which she inherited from her mother. When she was younger, she dreamed of becoming both a model and a Pok√©mon trainer, but gave up those dreams to run a restaurant after Ash was born.

Long ago she divorced her husband (the reason is not shown in the anime, but in the novelization of "Pocket Monsters: The Animation" the reason is revealed) and undertook to raise her son on her own. She has never been a Pokemon trainer, but in Alola Open House! has demonstrated real skill. This is how Delia won the trust of Mr. Mayme, who still helps her in the household.
