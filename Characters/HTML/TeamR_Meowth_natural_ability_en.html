<h2>Biography</h2>
Meowth was born homeless and lonely. Nobody loved him, and he decided to go to Hollywood. But there he lived hard, so he joined the gang of roving mutts. Together with this gang, he was robbing shops selling fried chicken (since then, fried chicken is Mouthwater's favorite food). It was a rather happy period of his life. Happy until he fell in love with Meowsi - a Pokemon cat (extremely arrogant, I must say) that belonged to some rich lady. To win her love, Meowt decided to become a man. He learned to walk on two legs, speak and write (the first letter he learned was the letter R. It is not known how his fate would have developed if it had been, for example, the letter "e"). But all his efforts were in vain: Meausi not only did not fall in love with him, but even began to consider him crazy. After this, Meowth left the gang and went to travel. His goal was to become the most powerful cat in the world. For this, he joined Team R.
