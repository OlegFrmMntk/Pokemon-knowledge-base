<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Being Goldeen, he was very kind, happy, cheerful and frivolous Pokemon and he always had a good mood. Even when his friends were in danger, he squealed joyfully. He was not afraid of anything, not even ghost Pokémon, because he did not understand that he had to be afraid. He easily found friends (for example, he was able to make friends with a voltorb). However, during the events of the Princess and Goldeen series and at the beginning of the Mirage and Goldeen! Series, Goldeen ceased to be frivolous when he defended Misty and her friends using his Protection, and also discovered that all the wild Goldeen in their Paradise was severely damaged by the vile plot of Colonel Hansen and his unclean heart. He is also willing to take risks when he sacrificed himself to save Misty and her friends by being attacked by two Dark Balls from the Ninjaskans of Hansen, to allow himself to be captured temporarily. Before evolving into Goldeens, he demonstrated his seriousness and determination to protect his relatives in their paradise, and also showed his patronage when using the "Protection" ability. He also retained his pre-evolutionary identity, thanks to Misty's caring nature, as Misty gave him a tearful farewell hug before he decided to guard all of Toghepi in their paradise. Goldeen was first used in Pokémon Emergency! to distract Team Rocket while Ash rescued the Pokémon in the Viridian Pokémon Center. Since Goldeen was a Water Pokémon that couldn't battle on land, it uselessly flopped on the ground until Misty recalled it seconds later.

Goldeen has proved helpful when Misty and her friends need assistance swimming or locating something underwater. In Pokémon Shipwreck, Goldeen tried to find an exit out of the sunken St. Anne. Instead, it discovered Team Rocket, who would otherwise have drowned, and brought them to the surface. Later, Goldeen towed Misty to the surface, while Starmie and Squirtle followed behind with Ash and Brock. It was later sent out to attempt to drag the raft away from James's Gyarados, but they were all caught up in the Dragon Rage and sent flying. It reappeared in Tentacool & Tentacruel, where it helped Staryu and Starmie rescue sailors who had been attacked.
