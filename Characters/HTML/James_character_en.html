<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Despite being a member of Team R, James has a soft and kind character. He is also very honest - for example, when Misty helped him cure Jesse, he did not attack her. He is also very romantic in nature, because he is often shown with a red rose. James considers himself very smart and beautiful, just loves to be in full view and attention. Unfortunately, his opinion is often ignored. When Team P appears in suits, he often puts on a women's outfit. Hates rivals on the Team - Cassady and Butch (so he pronounces the name of the latter as Butch, which makes him angry). Fans of the lids that it collects.
