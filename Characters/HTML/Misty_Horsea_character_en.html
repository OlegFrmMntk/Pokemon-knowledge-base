<h2>Chacarter</h2>
When it was used, it proved to be very resourceful - using ink to draw pictures or leave trails. It, like the rest of its species, prefers large bodies of water to swim in, hence, it grew sad and ill when it was forced to swim in small puddles of water, and Misty later left it at the Cerulean Gym, so that it could swim to its heart's content in the Gym's pool.
