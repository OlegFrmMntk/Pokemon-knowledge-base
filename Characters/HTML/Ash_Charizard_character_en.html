<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Charizard as Charmander was loyal, so naive that he believed that his coach, Damian, would return for him. However, upon learning the truth that Damian was a selfish person, he rejected him as his trainer and became one of Ash's Pokémon, knowing that Ash was a faithful, selfless and comprehensive better coach than Damian ever was. This shows the same loyalty and respect for Ash that he once had for Damian, he also became happy.

After evolving into Charmilion, his happy personality and loyalty disappeared. This was due to the fact that Charmilion's own level of skills grew faster than Ash. He did not respect him, for no apparent reason, he became slightly arrogant and self-confident. So during a practical battle in which Ash tried to help Paras Cassandra turn into Parasect, he answered, going against Ash's orders and mercilessly attacked Paras, causing him to flee in tears. Ash tried to remind Charmilion, but the latter used the Flamethrower on him, which hit Brock and Misty, the first of whom commented that Charmilion was out of control.
Charmilion Trevor from the X and Y season also shares this trait when he got out of control by attacking both Pikachu and Dedenne, especially Ashe and the group, when they reunited with Trevor. This is due to his passion for fighting other Pokémon.

His personality did not change much when he turned into Charisard, however, he rarely obeyed Ash's orders and sometimes used his Flamethrower on him to make Ash lag behind him or he annoyed him. Charizard agreed to fight only if he saw that the enemy was strong enough.
