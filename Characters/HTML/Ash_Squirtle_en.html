<h1>Ash's Squirtle</h1>
Squirtle was the sixth Pokémon that Ash had caught. Before Ash caught him, he was abandoned by an unknown coach along with several other Squirts, where they eventually formed the Squirt squad, and he became a leader. He soon fell in love with Ash after he saved him from a bomb blast carried out by Team R and decided to go with him because he allowed his unit to stay with local officer Jenny as firefighter Pokémon to put out fires for the local city.
