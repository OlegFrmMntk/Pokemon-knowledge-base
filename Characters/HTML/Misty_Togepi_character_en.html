<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Being Togepi, he was very kind, happy, cheerful and frivolous Pokemon and he always had a good mood. Even when his friends were in danger, he squealed joyfully. He was not afraid of anything, not even ghost Pok√©mon, because he did not understand that he had to be afraid. He easily found friends (for example, he was able to make friends with a voltorb). However, during the events of the Princess and Togepi series and at the beginning of the Mirage and Togepi! Series, Togepi ceased to be frivolous when he defended Misty and her friends using his Protection, and also discovered that all the wild Togepi in their Paradise was severely damaged by the vile plot of Colonel Hansen and his unclean heart. He is also willing to take risks when he sacrificed himself to save Misty and her friends by being attacked by two Dark Balls from the Ninjaskans of Hansen, to allow himself to be captured temporarily. Before evolving into Togetics, he demonstrated his seriousness and determination to protect his relatives in their paradise, and also showed his patronage when using the "Protection" ability. He also retained his pre-evolutionary identity, thanks to Misty's caring nature, as Misty gave him a tearful farewell hug before he decided to guard all of Toghepi in their paradise.
