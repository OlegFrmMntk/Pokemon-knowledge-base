<h2>Abilities</h2>
Goldeen is shown to be quite strong and fast, often being called upon to transport Misty or others in the water. In a true testament to its strength, Goldeen rescued the Team Rocket trio when they were trapped and drowning aboard the capsized St. Anne during Pokémon Shipwreck.

Goldeen wasn't seen very often due to it being a water-bound species, flailing when displaced from it. However, in water, Goldeen's potential shone through. Goldeen was shown to know a variety of techniques that has helped it defeat other Pokémon, such as Victreebel in The Stun Spore Detour. Its incredible Agility and deadly Horn Attack were amongst its best technique, though it was overwhelmingly a physical attacker. Goldeen faced difficulties against other Water-type specialists like Marina in Bye Bye Psyduck and Dorian in Just Add Water.
