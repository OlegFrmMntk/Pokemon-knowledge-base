In his debut, Crabby seemed fiery and daring, challenging Ash to fight, despite the fact that he was not even a Pokemon. However, after the capture, Crabby significantly softened and became a very modest and quiet Pokemon. Most likely, this is due to the fact that he lived with Professor Oak, who said in the series “Controversy in Poke Coral” that the Pokemon acquires the identity of the person who spends the most time with him. Kingler was determined in the battle, not giving up against Mandy, despite the fact that at face value he was an outsider against all three of his Pokemon. Kingler was a very modest winner, hugging his coach happily, but not waving the crowd and not gloating over Mandy. These are more of Oak's traits, unlike the rest of Ash's team. Most likely, that is why Kingler never held a permanent position in Ash's team. He turned out to be strong in battle, loyal and caring, but very little time spent together probably made Ash feel safer using his other Pokemon. Kingler, like Mack and Tauros, remains a bargaining chip in Ashe's arsenal.</body>
