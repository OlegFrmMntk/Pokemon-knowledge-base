<h1>Brock's Geodude</h1>
Geodude was first seen in Brock's rematch with Ash at the Pewter Gym. Initially, it was used against Pidgeotto; it was unfazed by Pidgeotto's Gust, demonstrating its strong defense, and as a result, it was able to defeat Pidgeotto without any trouble. It was then used against Pikachu, but was fried by a very powerful Thunderbolt, despite the fact that it is immune to Electric moves.
