<h1>Brock's Vulpix</h1>
Vulpix was given to Brock by Suzie in Pokémon Fashion Flash. Suzie was Brock's idol, and Vulpix took a liking to him, which was surprising, as the little Pokémon had a very snobbish nature. It even liked Brock's homemade Pokémon food. It drove away Team Rocket with a very powerful Fire Spin, driving home the point that a focus on outer beauty could eclipse a Pokémon's inner strength. Impressed with the way Brock cared for his Geodude and Ash's Pikachu, Suzie decided that Brock might be able to take better care of Vulpix than she could.
