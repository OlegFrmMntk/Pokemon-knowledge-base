Ash is the most recognizable <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">Pokemon trainer</sc_element>. Ash has brown eyes (inherited from his mother), black hair and two zipper marks under each eye. Before each trip to remote regions, his mother, Delia Ketchum, sews new clothes for Ash. Thus, in every region his appearance changes, but he always wears a cap with a visor. Ashâ€™s pupils were not visible, starting from the "<sc_element sys_idtf="Pokemon_Indigo_League">Indigo League</sc_element>" <sc_element sys_idtf="nrel_season">season</sc_element> in the original <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_series">series</sc_element> until the end of the Diamond and Pearl cycle, until the White and Black cycle made them deeper and more distinct.
