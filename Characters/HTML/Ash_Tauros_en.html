<h1>Ash's Tauros</h1>
First appeared in the "Legend of Dratini" series banned in the United States. Ash, Misty and Brock went to the Safari Zone to hunt Pokemon. There, by chance, Ash caught as many as 30 pieces. He used one of them more than once in battles. Now they are all in Professor Oak's lab.
