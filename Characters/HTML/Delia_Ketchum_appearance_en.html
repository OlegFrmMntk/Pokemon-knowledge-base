<h2>Appearance</h2>
Delia Ketchum is a slender woman with fair skin and brown eyes (which Ash inherited). Unlike her son (who has messy and spiky black hair), Delia has sleek brown hair, which she usually braids into a ponytail with a green hair tie. She usually wears a pink short-sleeved jacket, yellow tank top, purple skirt, and light green shoes, although her outfits vary.

While doing housework, Delia wears a light yellow T-shirt, pink apron, blue jeans (later replaced by a green dress), and orange shoes. However, she sometimes wears a straw hat and a purple skirt from her usual outfit.

When she saw Ash compete in the Indigo League and Joto League, Delia wore a blue dress with a white short-sleeved jacket and shoes. While on vacation in Alola, she wore an orange strapless dress with pink circles on the chest, a pink belt with a gold buckle, a pink flower, and white frills. She also wore a white coat, as well as a matching sun hat and pink sandals.

While sleeping, Delia wears yellow pajamas.
