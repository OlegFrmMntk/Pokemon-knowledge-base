<h1>Ash's Butterfree</h1>
The first Ash <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element> he caught in the wild.  <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_butterfree">Butterfree</sc_element> was caught as Caterpie and turned into Methapoda. The metapod then evolved, protecting Ashe and friends from the bidril swarm. Ash caught him only by throwing a pokeball. He once traded it for a Ratikate, but returned it back.  <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_butterfree">Butterfree</sc_element> was released to start a family life with her partner, pink Butterfree. Before winning the heart of his partner,  <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_butterfree">Butterfree</sc_element> saved a bunch of his wild relatives from Team R (this made the pink  <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_butterfree">Butterfree</sc_element> begin to feel for him).
