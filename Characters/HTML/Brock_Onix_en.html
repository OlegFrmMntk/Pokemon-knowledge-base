<h1>Brock's Onix</h1>
Brock received Steelix as an Onix from his father, Flint, on his tenth birthday, as seen in a flashback in Having a Wailord of a Time. Onix was Brock's first Pok√©mon and has consistently been his strongest. Onix was first seen in Showdown in Pewter City during Brock's Gym battle with Ash at the Pewter Gym, where it was used against Pikachu. Onix wasn't fazed by Pikachu's Thunder Shocks because of its secondary Ground type, and was easily able to subdue Pikachu with a Bind. Ash decided to forfeit the match because he couldn't stand to see Pikachu in pain. Onix was also used in Brock's rematch with Ash where it battled Pikachu once again. This time Pikachu's newly learned Thunderbolt attack was actually able to cause damage to Onix, though it was still not enough to defeat it. Onix once again had Pikachu in a Bind until Brock told it to stop because Brock didn't want to hurt Pikachu. Eventually Pikachu's Thunderbolt set off the sprinklers, severely damaging Onix because of its severe weakness to water. Pikachu took Onix down with one final Thunderbolt, but Ash chose to forfeit. Brock decided to give Ash the Boulder Badge anyway, and then joined him on his journey, bringing Onix with him.
