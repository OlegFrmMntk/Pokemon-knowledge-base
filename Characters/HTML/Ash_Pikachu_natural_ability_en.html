<h2>Abilities</h2>
Pikachu is far from the strongest kind of Pokemon, but Ash's Pokemon turned out to be a head tighter than his kinsmen. Back in the second series, Ambulance for Pokemon, Team Row Meowth described Pikachu as far beyond his standard level. Contrary to all forecasts, the Pokemon managed to defeat much stronger rivals, including the pseudo-legendary Dragonite in series 114 and the legendary Pokemon Regis in series 467. More than once Pikachu had to fight his evolution Raichu, and as a result, little Pokemon always came out victorious. Pikachu is a strong Pokemon who does not seek easy ways. Ash once had an electric stone, thanks to which Pikachu could evolve into raych. But time after time, Pikachu refused evolution, preferring to remain in his usual form. The main strength of Pikachu was not in the power of attacks, but in its speed and dexterity. It was thanks to his quick and accurate movements that Pikachu perplexed the Pokémon that were larger than himself. Pikachu is good at imitating other Pokémon or humans. Most often he uses it for entertainment, but sometimes in this way he tries to inform people that they cannot understand through his speech. Pikachu is constantly progressing, learning new attacks.
