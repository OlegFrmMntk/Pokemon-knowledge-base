<h2>Abilities</h2>
<sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> is far from the strongest kind of <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element>, but <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash's</sc_element> <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pikachu</sc_element> turned out to be a head tighter than his kinsmen. Back in the second series, Ambulance for <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pikachu</sc_element>, Team Row <sc_element sys_idtf="Meowth">Meowth</sc_element> described <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> as far beyond his standard level. Contrary to all forecasts, the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pikachu</sc_element> managed to defeat much stronger rivals, including the pseudo-legendary Dragonite in series 114 and the legendary <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pikachu</sc_element> Regis in series 467. More than once <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> had to fight his <sc_element sys_idtf="nrel_pokemon_evolution">evolution</sc_element> Raichu, and as a result, little <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pikachu</sc_element> always came out victorious. <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> is a strong <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pikachu</sc_element> who does not seek easy ways. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> once had an electric stone, thanks to which <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> could evolve into raych. But time after time, <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> refused evolution, preferring to remain in his usual form. The main strength of <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> was not in the power of attacks, but in its speed and dexterity. It was thanks to his quick and accurate movements that <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> perplexed the Pokémon that were larger than himself. <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> is good at imitating other Pokémon or humans. Most often he uses it for entertainment, but sometimes in this way he tries to inform people that they cannot understand through his speech. <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> is constantly progressing, learning new attacks.
