<h2>Chacarter</h2>
<sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> is a strong <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element> and one of <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash's</sc_element> most reliable partners. Whenever <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> is not around, <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> took the lead in his team. He is curious, smart, friendly, and shares <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash's</sc_element> love for the battles of <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element>. One of his most noticeable features is his determination and unwillingness to give up whenever the situation becomes difficult. He also showed himself responsible for the younger <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element>, in particular <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty_Togetic">Togepi</sc_element> <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element>, whom he often has to save from danger, putting himself in danger. Although sometimes stubborn, he obeys <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash's</sc_element> commands in battle and rarely leaves him. He is also an ongoing goal for Team R. They try to catch him, but in the few cases they do, <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> and his friends always frustrate their plans. Even after they got out of their traps, escaped capture or that he was not part of their schemes, <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> also interferes with his enemies by attacking or getting rid of them using his electric-type attacks such as his signature Lightning Bolt. He is very fast in battles. He can also imitate some <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element> and people, giving them a face shape.
