<h2>Chacarter</h2>
Pikachu is a strong Pokemon and one of Ash's most reliable partners. Whenever Ash is not around, Pikachu took the lead in his team. He is curious, smart, friendly, and shares Ash's love for the battles of Pokemon. One of his most noticeable features is his determination and unwillingness to give up whenever the situation becomes difficult. He also showed himself responsible for the younger Pokémon, in particular Togepi Misty, whom he often has to save from danger, putting himself in danger. Although sometimes stubborn, he obeys Ash's commands in battle and rarely leaves him. He is also an ongoing goal for Team R. They try to catch him, but in the few cases they do, Ash and his friends always frustrate their plans. Even after they got out of their traps, escaped capture or that he was not part of their schemes, Pikachu also interferes with his enemies by attacking or getting rid of them using his electric-type attacks such as his signature Lightning Bolt . He is very fast in battles. He can also imitate some Pokémon and people, giving them a face shape.
