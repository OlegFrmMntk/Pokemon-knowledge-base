Bulbasaur has an easygoing character, due to which it is good for beginner coaches. This is the most calm and peaceful of the Kanto startups. He was very good against the first two leaders of the Kanto stadiums. You must be a leader. The Bulbazavr can be very faithful, as in the series “The Mysterious Monster”, where the Bulbazavr has been waiting for the trainer to abandon him for many years. Complex communities with their own traditions and rituals, and even they are strangers. This is featured in the Mysterious Bulbasaur Garden series.
