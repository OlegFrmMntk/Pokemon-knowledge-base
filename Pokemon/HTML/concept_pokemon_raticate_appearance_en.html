<h2>Appearance</h2>
Raticate is a Rat Pokemon. His coat is mostly brown, only slightly lighter on the belly. Legs are short, with three clawed toes; the tail, like its prototype - the rat, is long and not covered with hair. On the head are the eyes, ears, nose, whiskers and mouth with large incisors characteristic of rodents. Raticate's teeth are constantly growing, so he always gnaws so that the incisors wear out and remain the required length. He gnaws everything from bark to stones. A long mustache on the face is needed for balance. Without them, the raticate will move more slowly, fearing to fall. Females have shorter whiskers and lighter hair than males. There are membranes on the hind legs, with their help, the raticate swims perfectly in the water, so it hunts for fish and swims across the rivers in search of food on the other side. In Alola, Raticate has become heavier and darker due to the urban environment and a higher-calorie diet. Its fur is mostly black with a brown leaf-shaped spot on the belly and brown ear shells. Its arms, legs, cheeks and tail are whitish-cream in color, and its arms are much smaller. He has large, chubby cheeks with four tendrils under his chin and two sprouting up on the side of the top of each cheek. His large incisors are still visible, but his eyes are now red. Raticate uses his nest as a food supply and usually prefers that the Alola Rattata, whom he commands, gather food while he stays in his nest and eats. He is selective in what he eats and only eats fresh, high quality food. Rumor has it that some upscale restaurant is even exploiting this selectivity by getting Raticate to buy ingredients and letting him taste new dishes.
