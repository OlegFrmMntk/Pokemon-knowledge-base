<h2>Appearance</h2>
Caterpie resembles a green caterpillar with yellow ring markings down the sides of her body. His most famous feature is the bright orange sensitive antennae on his head. They and large eye shape markings help scare away predators. This shares many features with other larval Pokémon, such as Widl and Wurmple, suggesting that their evolutionary lines are closely related. There are small papillae on the bases of Caterpie’s small legs, thanks to which the Pokémon can move around without fear of falling on trees and even on vertical surfaces. Although Caterpie is very small, his appetite is hoo. He can eat several leaves in a row much larger than himself. As he grows, the green scales of Caterpie become small for him. Caterpie is constantly molting, and at some point he drops all the scales, wraps himself with silk threads and prepares for evolution into a cocoon.
