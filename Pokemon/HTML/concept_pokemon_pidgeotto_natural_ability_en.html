<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Pidgeotto flies superbly. He can spend hours exploring the surroundings in search of enemies and prey. Having noticed the target, he sharply dives, hits with his beak and finishes off the victim, sticking sharp claws into it. Pokemon drags its prey in its beak to the nest, which sometimes can be at a distance of 100 km from the place of hunting. It feeds mainly on small Pok√©mon like caterpies and exegguts. Sometimes you can see how on-the-fly pidgeotto are caught by magicians jumping out of the water.
