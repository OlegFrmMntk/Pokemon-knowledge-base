<h2>Habitat</h2>
According to legends, it lives in the Kanto region. It spends winter in warm regions, and in spring it migrates to the north, carrying warmth with it. They say that if early spring has come, it means that Moltres flew to this region. Among the Orange Islands is Shamuti Island, where the Legends Festival is held every year. The islanders have a belief that legendary birds live on the nearby islands of Fire, Ice and Lightning, and once a struggle began between them, which unbalanced the forces of nature. Then all living things were on the verge of destruction. And only the song of the sea king Lugia and the help of the Chosen One were able to calm the great birds and restore stability on Earth.

Galar Moltres is considered a migratory Pokémon. He appears in the Crown of the Snow Land once every several decades. It has long been thought to be the Legendary Pokémon Moltres seen in other regions.
