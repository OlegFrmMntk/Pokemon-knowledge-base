<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Arkanayn has been revered since ancient times for its beauty, grace and speed. This is proved by ancient scrolls with drawings depicting a running Pokemon. In China, he is considered a legendary Pokemon. Everything about Arcanine delights people: its lush mane, courageous barking, which makes people tremble with delight and prostrate themselves. Few can compare with him in speed, it seems that he does not run, but flies, his run is so easy. He can run 10,000 km per day.

Among non-legends and non-pseudo-legends, Arkanayn takes the third place in terms of the amount of stats, second only to Slacking and Archeops.
