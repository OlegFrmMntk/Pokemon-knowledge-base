<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Charmander has long-range attacks - he exhales fire from his mouth. The power of fire attacks directly depends on his physical health. An experienced Charmander can learn powerful fire attacks: a flamethrower and a fire explosion. He also uses claw attacks, such as cuts, but they usually do less damage than fire. He can also learn how to exhale blue fire through the fury of a dragon. Charmander has the ability "Blaze", which increases fire attacks by 1.5 times, when health reaches 1/3 of the maximum, or less. Charmander’s hidden ability is the “Power of the Sun”, which under clear sky increases Special. The attack is 1.5 times, but takes 1/8 of maximum health at the end of each turn.
