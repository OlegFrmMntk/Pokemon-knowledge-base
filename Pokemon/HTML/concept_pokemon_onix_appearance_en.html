<h2>Appearance</h2>
Onix is a huge Pokemon that looks like a stone snake. It is the third longest among all Pok√©mon, only the stylix and the valord are longer. Onix's head is somewhat similar to a shark, possibly from a huge fin on the top of its head. The body consists of more than ten stones of uneven, round shape, the closer to the tail, the smaller the size of the stone. As the Onix grows, these stones become harder, just like diamonds, only black. In addition, the body of Onix is ground when rubbing against the ground, the stones become more round and smooth. It feeds Onix stones, it is believed that due to this Onix has such a strong body.
