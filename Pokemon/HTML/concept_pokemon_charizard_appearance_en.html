<h2>Appearance</h2>
Charizard is significantly different from its pre-evolutions. He has wings, thanks to which he can fly freely. Charizard also extended her neck and lengthened her tail. Now he has a more elongated face. There are two horns on the head, plus a horn on each wing. There are three claws on the legs. Outwardly Charizard is very similar to dragons from Western mythology. Charizard has a light red or orange skin, cream-colored belly. Inside, his wings are dark blue. Charizard is the only start-up with this feature. At the end of the tail, a flame burns, the size of which can be used to judge the strength and health of the charizard. Charizard and his pre-evolution are the only Pokémon for whom the flame is part of the body that cannot be put out without harming the Pokémon.
