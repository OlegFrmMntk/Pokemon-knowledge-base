<h2>Natural ability</h2>
There is a magnet in Onixâ€™s brain; it serves as a compass for Pokemon. Thanks to this, Onix, even in total darkness deep underground, always knows in which direction to move. He moves like a snake. It was the largest Pokemon which can be obtained from an egg. There are no special differences in appearance between males and females.
