<h2>Habitat</h2>
Originally from the Kanto region. Also found in Joto and Sinnoh. Rattata is an amazingly tenacious and hardy Pokemon, she can adapt to life in any conditions, but prefers to live on the plains among dense grass, where there is food. Most of their lives they are engaged in looking for food for themselves. If you see one Rattata somewhere, you can be sure that somewhere around there are forty more. Rattats are fertile at great speed and in large numbers, because they are small and it is difficult for them to fight alone for their lives with powerful predators. The Alolian form lives only on Alol.
