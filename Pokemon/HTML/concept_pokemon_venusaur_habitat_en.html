<h2>Habitat</h2>
Their homeland is the Kanto region. It is extremely rare in nature. They prefer to live in open sunny plains near large freshwater bodies of water. The Venusaur moves to always remain on the sunny side. Sometimes they live in forests and jungles. But most Venusaurs evolve from Bulbasaurs and Ivysaurs with trainers, so you need to look for them from trainers originally from Kanto.
