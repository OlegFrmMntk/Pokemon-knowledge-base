<h2>Appearance</h2>
Likitung can be classified as a reptile. He has a pink body color, but there are yellow stripes on his stomach and circles on his knees. There are growths and claws on the arms and legs. He is very fat, which makes him seem awkward. The Pokemon's tail is also long and very fluffy. Likitung's eyes are small black beads, his nose is just as small. Likitung always walks with his tongue protruding, which reaches almost to the very ground. Pokemon's tongue is very strong and dexterous, and therefore can be used in battle. Among other features, it emits a special sticky liquid that allows you to grab objects and even other small Pok√©mon.
