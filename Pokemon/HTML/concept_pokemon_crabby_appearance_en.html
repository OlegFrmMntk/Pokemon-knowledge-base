<h2>Appearance</h2>
Externally, crabby is very similar to a crab: its upper half, covered with a bone shell, is orange in color and has two protrusions. The lower half of the body is cream colored, and under the mouth there are two fangs. He also has four legs and two claws, which crabby uses as a weapon or for balancing when moving sideways.
