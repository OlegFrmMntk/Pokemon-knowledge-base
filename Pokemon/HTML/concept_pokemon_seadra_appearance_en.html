<h2>Appearance</h2>
Seadra is a water pokemon similar to a seahorse. This is a small, light blue skate with cream scales. It has a long muzzle and a series of spikes on the head - on the sides and on the forehead. The pectoral cider fins have sharp, pointed, cream-colored games, from which it secures poison. Seadra also has a large tail, which is usually folded.
