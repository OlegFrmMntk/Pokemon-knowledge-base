<h2>Habitat</h2>
Most Charmanders live with trainers. Originally from the Kanto region. It is extremely rare in nature. Sometimes they can be found in hot places, for example, near volcanoes. They can also be found in the rocky mountains and in caves along the coast of the Sevii islands. Charmanders are single, but sometimes they gather in groups for hunting.
