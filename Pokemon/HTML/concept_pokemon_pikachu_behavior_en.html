<h1>Behavior</h1>
Pikachu - calm and good Pokemon. They communicate well with each other, easily get used to other Pokémon (but it’s not clear whether all Pikachu can contact electro-pokemon with the help of lightning, or only Pikachu Ash can do this). Very friendly with their coaches. But if Pikachu or his companion is in danger, the pikachu, without hesitation, will rush into battle, using electricity, tail strokes and bites of sharp teeth. And, for example, if you pull it by the tail, then Pikachu will be painfully shocked. It’s better not to scare Pikachu, because a group of these Pokémon can develop such a powerful discharge that a thunderstorm will begin. Wild Pikachu in the woods do not get along well with people and prefer not to catch their eye.
