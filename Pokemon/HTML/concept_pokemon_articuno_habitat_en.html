<h2>Habitat</h2>
According to the legends, it lives on the territory of the Kanto region, somewhere on the very tops of the mountains. They say that only those who are lost in the snowy mountains can meet him. Articuno saves those who are on the brink of death. Although, in fact, it is possible that the affected people just think that they saw this Pokemon. Among the Orange Islands is Shamuti Island, where the Legends Festival is held every year. The islanders have a belief that legendary birds live on the nearby islands of Fire, Ice and Lightning, and once a struggle began between them, which unbalanced the forces of nature. Then all living things were on the verge of destruction. And only the song of the sea king Lugia and the help of the Chosen One were able to calm the great birds and restore stability on Earth.

This migratory Pokémon appears in the Crown of the Snow Land once every several decades. It has long been thought to be the Legendary Pokémon Articuno, seen in other regions.
