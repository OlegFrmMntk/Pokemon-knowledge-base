<h2>Natural ability</h2>
A Togetic can feel kindness in other people and the hearts of Pokemon. Whenever he notices an upright person, he usually flies to this person and showers him with happiness and radiance, called the "dust of joy." To share their happiness, they say that the Togetik flies around the world in search of these people. However, if he is not with kind people, he becomes depressed and loses energy.
