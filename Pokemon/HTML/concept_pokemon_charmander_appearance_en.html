<h2>Appearance</h2>
Charmander is a bipedal reptile of a reddish-orange color, with blue eyes and a creamy belly. Externally, Charmander looks like a dinosaur, in particular, a theropod. In the first generation, Charmander had small spikes on his back, but in the next generations they disappeared. A flame burns at the tip of his tail. This flame burns in him from birth. They say that if the fire goes out, Charmander will die. The size of the flame depends on the health of Charmander. The flame burns with the sound with which the fire burns. But you can hear it only with complete silence. Unlike an ordinary flame, the flame at the tip of its tail is very difficult to extinguish, otherwise Charmander would die in any water or ice attack. Charmander and its evolutions are the only Pokémon for which the flame is part of the body that cannot be put out without harming the Pokémon. Charmander has a very pretty appearance, but despite this, nothing will stop him from breaking the prey with his sharp claws. Charmanders have no particular difference between the sexes. Charmander is the first fire-type Pokémon and the first Pokémon in the National Pokedex with only one type. Charmander is the highest among all fire starters. He is the only fire-type Pokémon belonging to the breeding group Monsters.
