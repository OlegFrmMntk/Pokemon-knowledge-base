<h2>Habitat</h2>
Bulbasaurs are found in Kanto and in Hohen. They are rarely found in nature. Sometimes they can be found in secret places, such as gardens or plains near large freshwater surfaces (such as lakes). In such places, the Bulbazavra can be found lying in the sun during the day and photosynthesizing during times of food shortage, but usually these Pokemon are secretive and skillfully hide among plants. They can also hide in the forest in hollow logs, but still most often they can only be found with trainers. The Mysterious Bulbasaurus Garden series shows how the Bulbasaurs gather annually in the secret garden in Kanto to become Ivizaurs. It is not known whether this occurs in other regions where Bulbasaurs are less common. And it is not clear whether this is the only way of evolution.
