<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Blastoise can shoot water from cannons with force piercing steel, and with such accuracy that he gets into an empty can from a distance of 50 meters. Blastoise can also learn ice-type abilities such as ice ray and blizzard. Since Blastoise is the final evolution, it can use the "giga-momentum" and the "hydro-gun". He can quickly rotate in his shell, knocking down all the enemies in his path. Despite the fact that he is not of a steel type, this does not stop him from learning steel type attacks, such as a gyro ball and a sparkling gun, which help him against Pok√©mon with resistance to water, especially against grass ones. Blastoise has the ability to "flow", which increases water attacks by 1.5 times, when health reaches 1/3 or less. Blastoise also has the hidden property "Rain Dish", which allows you to restore 1/16 health at the end of each turn during rain.
