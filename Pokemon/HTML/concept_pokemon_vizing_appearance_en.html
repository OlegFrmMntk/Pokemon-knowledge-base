<h2>Appearance</h2>
The appearance of this Pokemon is very unusual - it resembles a coffing who has a bump in the form of himself. It is also a darker color. The facial expression also changes. On the large "face" you can see the same one-eyed skull with bones, and on the small one - a ring.

Its Galar uniform is gray in color and wears a "top hat" similar to factory chimneys. The poisonous gas forms "mustaches" and "beards" on his "faces".
