<h2>Appearance</h2>
Ekans is a large purple snake. There is a rattle on its tail. Its main color is purple; underbelly, rattle, eyes, and stripe near the head are yellow. It moves silently and unnoticed. Swallows eggs of birds such as pidzhi and spiro. Ekans can sever jaws to swallow huge prey whole. However, after that it becomes difficult for him to move.

The older Ekans is, the longer it is. At night, he winds around a branch and falls asleep. Often hides in the grass. Immediately after the emergence of exams, there is still no poison - at this time their bite hurts, but is harmless.

Seeing the trapping disc, Ekans will immediately crawl towards him.
