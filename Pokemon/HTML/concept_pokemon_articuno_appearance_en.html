<h2>Appearance</h2>
Articuno is a large bird with blue plumage. Its color is darker on the crest and long, flowing tail. His body is tinted sky blue, while everything is lighter on its front, and his chest is lighter than blue. Its distinguishing feature is its large wings, which are said to be made of ice. His eyes are of a medium shade of red.

The Galarian form of Articuno is a bird of the same size as the original Articuno, although it is lighter in weight. This Pokemon has a light purple feather tint instead of light blue. The parts that were blue turned dark purple. Pok√©mon's chest has a black plumage, which, unlike the Kanto version of Articuno, starts from the head and continues to the end of the body. Also, black plumage is present on the Pokemon's head, as a "mask". The Pokemon has blue glowing eyes without pupils. The Pokemon's wings have a white gradient at the tips of the feathers, when using psychic attacks, the eyes glow with a blue light, and the ends of the mask light up with a light blue fire.
