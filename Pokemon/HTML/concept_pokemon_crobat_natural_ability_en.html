<h2>Natural ability</h2>
From previous evolutions, the Crobat got echolocation, thanks to which he is able to avoid collisions with obstacles even in absolute darkness. Due to two pairs of wings, he is able to cover long distances without interrupting rest - as soon as one pair of wings gets tired, he simply uses the other. Also, his flight is silent, which allows him to quietly sneak up on prey. However, due to the lack of paws, the crobat is extremely vulnerable on the ground.
