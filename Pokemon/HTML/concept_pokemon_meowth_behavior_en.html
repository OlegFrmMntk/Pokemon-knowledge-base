<h2>Behavior</h2>
In general, this Pokemon is very cocky and arrogant. He is always ready to steal food. Meowts attract round and shiny objects. As a night Pokemon, he is known to wander the streets of the city at night and picks up everything that sparkles, including small money. When a sparkling object is detected, his eyes will shine, and the coin on his forehead will shine brightly. He shares this intrigue with Markrow, with whom he often fights for objects and loot. Meowt is a playful but fickle Pok√©mon with the ability for human intelligence. At least one of the representatives of the species learned to speak.
