<h2>Behavior</h2>
Wartortle is dedicated to his coach. He is more aggressive than a squirt. When the warthorl hunts, he hides under the water and suddenly emerges to catch the victim by surprise. As you know, Wartortlees are very strong Pok√©mon and have a lot of scratches on their shells from past battles. They are considered good pets, because they live a very long time. It is believed that they can live 10,000 years, but this is probably a myth (no one has lived so much to test).
