<h2>Behavior</h2>
Compared to his evolutions, Charmander is very calm and sweet. By the light on the tail, one can judge his mood. For example, if he gets angry, the flame gets bigger. It is quite rare in nature, most of them live with Professor Oak and are given to beginner trainers. And for beginner trainers it is always better to choose Pokemon with a calm character. But it will not be easy for beginners with Charmander, because the first two stadiums, Broca and Misty, use stone and water Pok√©mon, against which Charmander has no advantages.
