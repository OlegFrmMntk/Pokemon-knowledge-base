<h2>Behavior</h2>
After evolution, the good Charmander has a dramatic change in character. Charmeleon is very quick-tempered, stubborn and almost uncontrollable. He is constantly looking for someone to fight with. This is due to the fact that after evolution, his strength increases sharply, and because of this, he does not consider it necessary to always obey the coach. Therefore, the trainer needs some time to establish relations with the Charmeleon, only then the Pokemon will begin to obey. The fighting character of the Charmeleon is also characterized by the fact that he wants to evolve as soon as possible and therefore constantly climbs into the fray.
