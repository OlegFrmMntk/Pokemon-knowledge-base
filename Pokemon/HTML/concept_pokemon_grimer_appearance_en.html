<h2>Appearance</h2>
A Grimer consists of hardened dirt and slush. Some believe that this Pokemon is born from polluted sea waters, others that from dirt under the influence of x-rays of the moon. Grimer stinks terribly like a rotting pile of garbage, although it seems he can control this process and not stink unnecessarily.
