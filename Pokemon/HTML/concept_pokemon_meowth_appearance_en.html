<h2>Appearance</h2>
Meowtр is a small pokemon cat with creamy fur that turns brown at the tips of its hind legs and tail. Its ovoid head has four protruding antennae, wide eyes with split pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and a gold coban coin embedded in the forehead. His ears are black with brown innards and between an extra pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a four-legged Pokémon that can walk on its hind legs; while games always portray Meowt on two legs, the anime says that Meowts usually walk on all fours. He can freely manipulate his claws, drawing them in when he wants to move quietly. The tip of the tail is strongly twisted.
