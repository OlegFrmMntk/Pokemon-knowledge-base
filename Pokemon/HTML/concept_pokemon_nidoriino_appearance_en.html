<h2>Appearance</h2>
Nidoriino is a fairly large purple Pokemon that looks like a rabbit, like its pre-evolution, only it looks more aggressive. It has sharp protruding front fangs, huge ears and enlarged spines on its back from which it releases venom. The spots on the skin of nidoriino are darker than those of nidoran, and the horn on the head is larger and more dangerous.
