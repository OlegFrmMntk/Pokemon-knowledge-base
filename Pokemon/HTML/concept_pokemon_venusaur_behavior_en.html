<h2>Behavior</h2>
Venusaur is a very calm and cold-blooded Pokemon. He does not lose his temper even in emergency situations. I am loyal to my trainer, but we must remember that the venusaur is a very strong Pok√©mon with special battle tactics, so it needs an experienced trainer. Venusaurs conduct annual evolution ceremonies of bulbasaur away from people every year.
