<h2>Behavior</h2>
Vulpix is a rather calm and kind Pokémon, but he is not sociable and likes to spend time alone or only with his trainer. In no case should you try to stroke someone else's vulpix, they do not like strangers and immediately begin to exhale fire. In battle, wild Pokémon do not shun deception. For example, he may pretend to be wounded in order to mislead the enemy and inflict a sudden blow on him or run away.
