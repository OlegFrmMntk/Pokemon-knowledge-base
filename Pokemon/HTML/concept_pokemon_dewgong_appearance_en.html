<h2>Appearance</h2>
The size of this Pokemon is huge, as well as its weight. From his mouth, like Siil, tusks are visible. Only in Siil they grow from the bottom up, and in Dewgong they grow quite the opposite: from the upper jaw. He also has no legs. Only forepaws, which have a similar structure with fish fins. His tail also looks like a fish. At the top of his head a small horn sticks out. He has a very rich white coat, which allows him to hide in the snow.
