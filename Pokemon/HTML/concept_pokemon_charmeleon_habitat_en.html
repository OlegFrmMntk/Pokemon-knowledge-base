His homeland is the Kanto region. It is extremely rare in nature. Most of the Charmeleons evolve from tamed Charmanders. Sometimes they can be found in the rocky mountains and active volcanoes. In the mountains where these Pok√©mon live at night, you can see many lights, as if stars are shining there, but, in fact, this is the light of the flame of the tails of Charmeleons. They also love to live in abandoned mines. Omnivores. Unlike Charmanders, they hunt alone.
