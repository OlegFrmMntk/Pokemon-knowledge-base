<h2>Appearance</h2>
Blastoise is a large, blue turtle that walks on two legs. He has a strong shell and two powerful water cannons made of a material similar to steel, they are located on the top of the shell from different sides. Blastoise can pull them in or turn them back so that the jet helps him crush his opponents. Blastoiseâ€™s head is strong and durable, which allows him to ram enemies in battle. In this he is also helped by triangular ears, which he sets forward, using as horns. On his thick and furrowed arms are three claws. A white ring around the shell surrounds his shoulders. Unlike Squirtle and Wartortl, the tail of Blastoise is blue and short.
