<h1>Physiology</h1>
Pikachu is a small yellow Pok√©mon. It is considered a mouse or a squirrel, but it looks more like a rabbit. It has long, very sensitive ears, and a long zigzag tail. It looks like lightning, and lightning is connected to electricity. The tips of his ears are black, on the back there are two dark brown stripes. The same dark brown color at the base of the tail. Pikachu has four fairly short legs, which does not prevent him from developing great speed and making long jumps. It moves mainly on all four. But, if desired, is able to walk on two rear. Pikachu's face has two round dark brown eyes, a tiny black nose and a mouth with a typical cleft lip. Cheeks highlighted in red. It is known that it is in the cheek pockets that he produces electricity. Males and females have differences in appearance. In females, the edge of the tail is not straight, but resembles the shape of a heart. But this difference appeared only in games of the fourth generation.
