<h2>Behavior</h2>
Haunter - In the hands of a persistent and patient trainer, he can be a very dangerous Pokemon, even if he is not caught. If you feel someone's gaze on you, but you can't see anyone around, there is reason to think that Haunter is following you, as Pokedex says. In the anime, Haunter is shown as a very funny pokemon Pokemon who loves to play and have fun. And at the same time, very vulnerable, if you offend him, he can cry. Well, trainers need to know that Haunter is not a very unreliable Pokemon, but at the same time touchy, he can sometimes let him down, but once he will make him proud.
