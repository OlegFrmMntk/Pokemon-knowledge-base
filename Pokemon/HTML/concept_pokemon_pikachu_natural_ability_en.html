<h1>Natural ability</h1>
Pikachu has a special ability that other Pokemon does not have - to give out an electric discharge of different strength at the request of Pokemon. This property is due to the special arrangement of pouches in his cheeks. Sometimes Pikachu accumulates too much charge in the cheeks, then he needs to urgently discharge, otherwise he starts to feel bad, and even a fatal outcome is possible.
