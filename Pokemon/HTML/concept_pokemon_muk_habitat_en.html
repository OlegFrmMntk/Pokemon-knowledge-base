<h2>Habitat</h2>
This pokemon hails from the Kanto region. Muks live in groups, often poppies become the head of several Gprimers. They prefer warm and humid regions, where a lot of dirt and waste is collected, from which the stench becomes simply unbearable. Itâ€™s very difficult to notice a Muk, because it is often disguised as puddles and dirt.
