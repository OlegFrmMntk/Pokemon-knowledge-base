<h2>Appearance</h2>
Rattata is a rat-like Pokemon. Almost all of its fur is purple, only the lower part of the muzzle, antennae, abdomen, hands and feet are beige. The rattata has ears on its head, two antennae on the cheeks, red eyes and a mouth with especially well-developed incisors. This Pokemon also has four legs and a tail that is curled at the end. The rattata's teeth are constantly growing, so the Pokemon gnaws something hard all the time, so that the teeth wear off and do not grow larger than the prescribed size. The Rattata are not native to Alola and arrived on cargo ships. The Rattat population in Alola flourished until the Yungoos was imported as a control measure. To avoid new predators, Rattata changed his habits. He moved to more urban areas, became nocturnal, and formed large nests led by Raticates. Alolian Rattata searches for fresh food by smell and ignores anything spoiled. It is even known that he sneaked into people's homes to find food. It has dark gray fur and grayish purple ear shells. There are two tufts of fur on each ear and near the tip of the tail. Its long, thin mustache is also replaced by shorter, thicker tufts of fur. The line where his creamy belly meets gray fur is ragged, not smooth.
