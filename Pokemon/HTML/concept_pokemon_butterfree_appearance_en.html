<h2>Appearance</h2>
Butterfree is a blue Pokemon butterfly. Butterfree has large, luxurious white wings with black edges. Big, oval butterfly eyes are red. Two long antennae stick out on the head. The front legs of the Pokemon are very short. The hind legs are small in height, but they have a large foot length, so that the pokemon can, while standing, maintain balance, despite the outweighing wings behind its back. The female butterfly wings on the lower wings have black spots.
