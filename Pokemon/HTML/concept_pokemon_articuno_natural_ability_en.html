<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Articuno controls snow and ice, can cause blizzards and blizzards, for which he is called the titanium of ice. When it flaps its wings, the moisture in the air freezes and turns into snow. Therefore, when he flies, snow always falls.

In terms of physical strength, Articuno is the most powerful of the three legendary birds; as shown in the anime, Articuno is able to lift one of Team R's machines with his clawed paws.

Galar Articuno fights using intense psychic powers that directly target the cells of living beings. The beams of psychic energy that he shoots out of his eyes have a particularly powerful effect. If these rays hit the enemy, they will completely deprive him of mobility and he will look frozen. The Pokémon finishes off its immobilized foes using the concentrated psychic power of its wings. Judging by the appearance of the Pokémon, it can be assumed that it has the ability to "levitate", although this may not be the case.

Galar Articuno is the only Pokémon that can learn the Freezing Radiance special move.
