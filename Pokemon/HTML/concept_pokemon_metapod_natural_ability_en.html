<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Metapod battles are not for the faint of heart. Armless, footless Pokemon cannot move, the only attack in his arsenal is Hardening. So either pair with the metapod of another Pokemon ... or stock up on popcorn and a sleeping bag, the battle will be long. In fact, after the evolution of metapods, it remembers the attacks of Caterpie, but theoretically, without the ability to move, he still cannot fight.
