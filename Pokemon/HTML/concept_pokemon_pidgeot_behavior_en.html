<h2>Behavior</h2>
Pidgeot is usually a calm and self-confident Pokemon. But he does not favor strangers in his vast territories, therefore, one must be careful there and not fall under sharp claws. Pidgeotas often become the leaders of pidgeot and pidgey packs. At times, pidgitas are the only protection for their lesser brothers from harmful spearow and fearow.
