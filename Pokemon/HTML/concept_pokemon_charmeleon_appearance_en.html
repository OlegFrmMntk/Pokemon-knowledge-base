<h2>Appearance</h2>
Charmeleon is a two-legged reptile. It has dark red scales, much darker than the Charmander. Behind him is a long tail, at the end of which a flame constantly burns. Charmeleon has three large white claws on its front and hind legs. After evolution, a muzzle stretched out, and a kind of horn appeared on his head. A Charmeleon and its evolution are the only Pokémon for which the flame is part of the body that cannot be put out without harming the Pokémon. There are no special differences in appearance between males and females. Charmeleon and Charizard are of the same species as Flareon, Moltres, and Infernaip. Namely, Pokemon flame.
