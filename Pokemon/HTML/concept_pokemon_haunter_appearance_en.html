<h2>Appearance</h2>
His body color is purple. The shape of its body is close to round, but there are several flaws. The muzzle vaguely resembles a cat's. On the crown there are sharp ears, and along the perimeter of the body there are something like spikes. He has very large eyes and a lot of small but sharp teeth in his mouth. His hands are not attached to his body; they fly near him. Each hand has 3 fingers. Pokemon moves by levitation.
