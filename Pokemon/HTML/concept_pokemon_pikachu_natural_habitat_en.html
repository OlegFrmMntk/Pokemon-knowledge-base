<h1>Natural habitat</h1>
Pikachu homeland is the Kanto region. Mostly live in forests, but, for unknown reasons, they are often drawn to cities. Perhaps the fact is that they are of an electrical type. There were times when Pikachu even went into people's homes, attracted by the electric fields of household appliances. Pikachu is often harmed by humans. They do not mind gnawing wires, and their electricity affects the proper operation of many devices. Wild Pikachu wander in groups and only occasionally settle in the same territory. Pikachu often become pets. They are not very difficult to catch, they are not demanding and they do not need any special living conditions. Just do not forget to sometimes take them to discharge. Pikachu can be found in all six regional Pokedexes, although he comes from Kanto. He was brought from Kanto to the safari zone in Hohenn and to the garden of Mr. Bacloth's house in Sinno. But how he ended up in Fiore and Almiya is not explained, so perhaps these lands can also be considered the birthplace of Pikachu. Wild Pikachu can be found in all regions except Dzhoto. He also does not meet in Yunovo.
