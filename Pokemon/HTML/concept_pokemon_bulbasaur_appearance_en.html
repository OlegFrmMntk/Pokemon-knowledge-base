<h2>Appearance</h2>
Researchers are not sure to classify the bulbasaur as a plant or animal. It is essentially a cross between a dinosaur dicinodont and a toad. Bulbasaurs have no particular difference between the sexes. But it was noticed that Bulbasaurus May (female) had a heart-shaped spot on his head, while Bulbasaur Ashe (male) did not have it. This is the third <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> in the anime that has a heart-shaped stain on its body. The other two are spin and wooper. Bulbasaurs walk on four legs, but can stand on two. With <sc_element sys_idtf = "nrel_pokemon_evolution">evolution</sc_element>, they lose this ability because the flower on the back becomes too heavy. That is why the <sc_element sys_idtf = "nrel_pokemon_evolution">evolution</sc_element> of the Bulbasaur has a much lower speed.
