<h2>Appearance</h2>
Arkanain is a large, robust four-legged dog-like Pokemon. Arcanine is predominantly covered with red hair, with thick black stripes. The Pokemon's head is almost entirely covered with long beige hair, except for the eyes and ears. Arkanain's eyes are oval, almost always frowned, with black irises. At about eye level, this Pokemon has red diamond-shaped ears, covered with beige fur on the inside. Arkanayn's nose is black, triangular in shape. Below the nose is the muzzle, from which two upper canines stick out. Arkanain's neck, like his head, is covered with long beige fur. Long tufts of fur grow on its paws: on the front, they are located on the elbows, and on the back, they completely cover the ankles. Arkanin's tail is bent and completely covered in long beige fur. The fur is disheveled above the fold and at the tip.
