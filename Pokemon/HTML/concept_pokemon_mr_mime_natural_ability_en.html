<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Mister Mime has the Soundproofing ability or the Filter ability. Soundproofing makes Mr. Mime immune to "sound" movements. The filter causes all the super effective actions to weaken it. Mister Mime is gifted with the art of imitation at a young age, but as he grows, he gains the ability to make invisible objects by emitting energy from his fingers and instantly vibrating his fingertips to solidify around them and form a wall. Barriers generated in this way can repel harsh attacks, and his gestures and movements can convince observers that something invisible actually exists. Once this is achieved, the perceived element materializes. Mr. Mime is very proud of his pantomime performances and will hit anyone hard, which interrupts them while he mimics.
