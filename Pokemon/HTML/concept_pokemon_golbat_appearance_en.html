<h2>Appearance</h2>
Golbat - a small Pokemon, outwardly similar to a purple-colored bat with purple membranes on its wings. On the head are large ears and a large toothy mouth. He also has long lower limbs and large wings. The tooth has no eyes, so it uses sound waves to navigate, like a real bat does. Female tooths have smaller Golbat than males. Also, the Golbat do not tolerate sunlight, as it burns their sensitive skin and fur.
