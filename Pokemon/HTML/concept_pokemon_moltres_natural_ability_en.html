<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Moltres is a legendary bird of fire. Each flap of his wings triggers a blinding burst of fire. Its fire is so bright that even at night it paints the sky red. The sight of Moltres flying is awe-inspiring. Moltres controls fire and draws power from it. The wounded Moltres plunges into the mouth of a volcano and bathes in magma to heal.

A special talent for Galar Moltres when attacking the enemy's mind, during which he spreads his wings wide and unleashes a vicious aura on the enemy. Opponents attacked in this way feel terrible fatigue, as if all their energy had been burned out at once.
