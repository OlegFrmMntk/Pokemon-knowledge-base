<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Like a water pokemon, Squirtle has many water attacks. Including it can let a water stream or bubbles from a mouth. Among his attacks are a water gun, a hydraulic pump. Squirtle's peculiarity is that he can use his water attacks, even hiding in a shell. Squirtle can also be taught ice attacks. In the event of an attack, Squirtle hides in a shell and waits for danger. The carapace has a streamlined shape, which allows Squirtle to move quickly in the water. Also, thanks to the carapace, Squirtle can learn such attacks as rapid rotation and a skull strike. On its carapace, Squirtle can transport small Pokémon on water. Squirt evolutions are the only Pokémon that can learn bubble attack, but cannot learn a bubble ray. Only in the second generation did TM appear with this attack. The hidden property is Rain Dish.
