<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Due to the fact that the Pokemon has a large weight and short legs, it moves very slowly. If he can roll, then he rolls. If it starts to roll, then a speed will rise that can hardly be stopped, only if you crash into a rock. Everything that got in his way, he easily moves and does not leave a living place. If a rake has come across your path, then wait for the death to die, because its great weight and speed will erase you into powder. From the fact that he often rolls, his body grinds or pieces fly off from him. But such trifles worry Graveler little.
