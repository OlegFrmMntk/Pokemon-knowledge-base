<h2>Behavior</h2>
Despite its size, Blastoise is a very good-natured and calm Pokemon. Blastoises can be careful at first, but be very good allies in battle. Basically they take on the role of leaders in large groups of Squirts and Wartortles. Blastoise firmly rests his feet on the ground before starting to spray, so that the recoil is not too strong. According to The Complete Pokemon Pocket Guide, he uses his heavy body as a ram.
