<h2>Appearance</h2>
It differs little from its pre-evolution, mainly only in large size. Its plumage has become larger and more beautiful. The comb of feathers on the head is much longer than that of a pidgeot, and the color is yellow and red. The tail feathers are red. As with previous evolutions, the underbelly is brown in color, and the same black spots around the eyes. The magnificent crest of the pidgeot enthralls anyone who sees it. Beautiful plumage and powerful attacks made pidgeot a favorite of many trainers.
