<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Rattata's main strength is in her teeth. Pokemon can gnaw anything with them. Rattata also relies heavily on his speed, nature has deprived her of strength, so you have to twirl around to confuse the enemy. Life made the Pokemon be careful, even in a dream, she herself, without noticing it, moves her ears and listens to all the rustles.
