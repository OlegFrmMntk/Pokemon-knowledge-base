<h2>Natural ability</h2>
The Grimer has a special body structure that allows him to crawl through any even the smallest crevices. Thanks to this, he moves through sewer pipes. He specializes mainly in poisonous attacks, especially those related to throwing mud. In principle, it can learn attacks of almost all types. A Grimer may have a Stench ability or an Attached Hold ability. Stench reduces the chance of encountering wild Pokémon when Greimer is the first-hand Pokémon. Attached hold prevents theft of his holding subject. He enters the sewers and other areas with great ease because of his rubber and semi-viscous body; For example, it can enter forbidden zones, slipping between narrow bands. If you reach out to Greimer, it will be very difficult to receive.
