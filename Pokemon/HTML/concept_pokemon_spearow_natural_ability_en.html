<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Due to its short wings, Spearow cannot climb too high, and also cannot withstand long flights. But he can fly as fast as an arrow to check his territory for possible intruders. Spearow is a rather weak opponent, but he can provide a decent reception using his attacks, among which there is a repetition of an attack.
