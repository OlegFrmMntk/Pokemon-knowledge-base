<h2>Habitat</h2>
Pidgeotto usually live in dense forests with tall trees. These birds capture vast territories and keep them under their control. Any intruder is waiting for beats or something worse. You should always be on the lookout in the forests, because where the territory of one pidgeotto ends, as a rule, the territory of another begins.
