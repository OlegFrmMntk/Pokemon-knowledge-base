<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Thanks to the bulb, the Bulbasaur performs attacks such as vines, cutting leaves, leech seed, petal dance and a sweet aroma. According to the anime, grape lashes come out from under the bulb. They Bulbasaur can attack. Cutting sheets are also produced from under the bulb. The hole at the top of the bulb shoots with leech seeds, releases petals and a sweet aroma. Due to the ability of the bulb to absorb sunlight, synthesis synthesis and sunlight are available to the Bulbasaur. The Bulbasaur is the only Pokémon able to learn the petal dance attack through reproduction. In Kanto, the Bulbasaur has more advantages with respect to stadium leaders than other starting Pokémon. Its grassy type makes it a strong adversary against Pokémon in the stadium of Puter, Cirulin and Viridian. His herbal and poisonous types also allow him to resist Pokémon in the stadiums of Vermilion and Celadon. He has weaknesses only for Pokémon in Zinnibar and Saffon Stadiums.
