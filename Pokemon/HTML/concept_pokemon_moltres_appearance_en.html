<h2>Appearance</h2>
Moltres is a large, bird Pokémon with orange or gold plumage. The body of the Pokemon itself is oval, from it comes a long neck with a small round head. It has a long, straight, smooth dull brown crest. Pokemon's eye sockets are triangular in shape. The irises themselves are blue-gray. On the head of the Pokemon, as an additional plumage, a column of fire is burning. From the yellow body of the Pokemon, frail wings go, more reminiscent of sticks with plumage. The inner side of the wings is covered with fire. Moltres' paws are dull brown in color, rather slender, have three toes with white claws, as well as one opposite. The Pokemon's tail is a simple pillar of fire.

The Galar form of Moltres - has an ash black plumage, also more weight, although the height remains the same as that of the Kanto version. Its beak, unlike the Kanto version, has a curved tip and a bright crimson color. From the beak, this color continues down the back and belly of the Pokemon to the beginning of the tail, in a line. On the head of the Pokemon there is a plumage in the form of a column of fire of black, pink and bright crimson, separate from each other. The paws of Galar Moltres are bright crimson in color, have three toes with black claws, as well as one opposed. The Pokémon's wings are quite powerful compared to the weak ones that the Kanto version had. From the black base of the wings comes a bright crimson fire and pink, forming feathers. The Pokemon's tail is split in two, although the base is the same. The fire on the tail is similar to the fire on the head. Galar Moltres' eyes are blue in color and also much more rounded than his Kanto version. The energy inside his body erupts in a form that looks like a flame, which prevents most Pokémon from even getting close to him.
