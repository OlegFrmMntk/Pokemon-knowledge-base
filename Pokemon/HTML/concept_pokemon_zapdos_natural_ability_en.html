<h2>Natural ability</h2>
The flaps of his wings cause lightning, so wherever he appears, the sky instantly darkens and a terrible thunderstorm begins. The Pokemon itself draws power from lightning, freely controlling electricity. It can recharge Electric Pokémon. When it flies, it is not the soft rustle of wings that is heard, but the crackling and clicking of electrical discharges.

The Galar Zapdos does not have powerful wings like the other birds in this trio, but it does have powerful anisodactyl legs. With the help of his paws, he can confuse the enemy and deliver a series of quick kicks to win.

Galar Zapdos is the only known Pokémon that can learn the Lightning Kick movement.
