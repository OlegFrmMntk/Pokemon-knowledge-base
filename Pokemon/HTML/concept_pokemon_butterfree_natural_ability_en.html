<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Butterfly wings are covered with a special poisonous pollen, it is able to repel water, so that the wings of a Pokemon do not get wet even in heavy rain. The same pollen is used by the Pok√©mon in battle: the butterfly swings its wings quickly, the pollen enters the air and poisons the enemy. Every day, you can see a butterfly flying from one flower to another in search of nectar. Pokemon is capable of smelling at a great distance (up to 6 miles) to feel where the blooming flower is, even if there is a little nectar there. Having found a flower, butterfly pollen polishes its legs, covered with special hairs. Pollen clings well to the hairs, and in this form, the Pokemon returns without problems to the nest with prey.
