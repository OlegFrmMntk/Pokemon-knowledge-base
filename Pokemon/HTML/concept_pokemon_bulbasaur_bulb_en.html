<h2>Bulb</h2>
The bulb is filled with nutrients. At first, the newborn Bulbasaur lives solely due to this reserve. A bulbasaur may not eat at all, but live solely due to photosynthesis or energy stored in the bulb. From birth, a seed sprouts on the back of a Bulbasaur. It becomes an onion that grows with Pokemon. With its help, Pokemon can absorb sunlight and process into nutrients. The bulb is also responsible for many Pokemon attacks. Bulbasaur and plant live in symbiosis. Also in the bulb are seeds, pollen, and from it grow vines, used in battle and for moving.
