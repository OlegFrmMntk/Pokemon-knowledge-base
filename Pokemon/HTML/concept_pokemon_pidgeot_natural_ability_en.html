<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Already by one size of the pidgeot it is clear that this is a very strong Pokemon. Its long and powerful wings can cause such winds that bend trees. In speed, it is difficult to compete with a pidgeot, because it can fly 2 times faster than the speed of sound. At the same time, it rises to 1 km into the sky, even from there the keen pokemon can look out for its prey, for example, a magikarp who has jumped out of the water. At such moments, a pidgeot dives down and grabs a gaping Pokemon with huge claws.
