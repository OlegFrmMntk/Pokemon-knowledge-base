<h2>Appearance</h2>
Metapod - Pokemon-cocoon of green color. What we see is just a shell, protection for a very vulnerable Pokemon body at this stage of development. The shell itself is not too hard, but the metapod has ways to make it so hard that even a strong Pok√©mon is hard to break. And yet, if the metapod does not have time to protect itself, there is always a chance that the shell will collapse and the Pokemon will fall out (although this method is not shown in the anime). While still a caterpillar, the Pokemon ate well and a supply of nutrients, because being in such armor, you do not run into much in search of food. And the energy reserve of the Pokemon is vital. All the time the metapod is in the cocoon, patiently and motionlessly waits for nature to do its job and transform the body of the caterpillar into a Butterfree.
