<h2>Habitat</h2>
His homeland is the Kanto region. It is rare in nature. Most of them are distributed by Professor Oak to young coaches, so the squirt is basically all tamed. In nature, it can be found on small isolated islands in the middle of the seas and oceans. Sometimes it swims in the rivers that flow in large canyons. But mostly Squirtle prefers small ponds and lakes.
