<h2>Behavior</h2>
Very friendly pokemon. Growlites are well known for their bravery and amazing loyalty. If necessary, he will easily challenge a stronger opponent. It switches to "biting" mode only when an alien invades the territory protected by the Pokémon or when attacking the trainer. For the sake of the trainer, the Pokemon is ready to sacrifice his life.

Thanks to these qualities, growlith has become the main Pokémon assistant to police officers, and it is also well suited for fiddling with children.
