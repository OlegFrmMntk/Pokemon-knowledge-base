<h2>Behavior</h2>
Squirtle has a fairly calm character, although sometimes it is difficult to control. In this regard, it is harder to train than Bulbasaur, but easier than Charmander. Squirtle is very attached to his relatives. But, nevertheless, he gets along well with other species of Pokemon. Wild Squirtle are pretty distrustful of humans. Squirtle and Pikachu can become good friends.
