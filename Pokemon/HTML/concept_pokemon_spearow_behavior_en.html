<h2>Behavior</h2>
Spearow is easily pissed off. They have a bad temper and love to attack other Pokémon and humans. And they do it in packs, because they are too weak individually. They very reverently defend their territory, and the whole community attacked the enemy. Spearow hate Pidgey, with whom they often live in the same places and hunt for the same prey. It's not uncommon for clashes between these two types of Pokémon.
