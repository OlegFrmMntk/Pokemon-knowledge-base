<h2>Habitat</h2>
Vulpix comes from Kanto. It lives on grassy plains, near active volcanoes and in rocky mountains. Sometimes they can be found in cities, for example, in parks, but only at night. Vulpixes are terribly loved by girls for their beautiful appearance, so they can often be seen with coaches and coordinators. Ice vulpixes can be found on Alola high in the mountains.
