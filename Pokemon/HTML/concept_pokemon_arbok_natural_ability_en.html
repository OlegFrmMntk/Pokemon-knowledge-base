<h2>Natural ability</h2>
To scare prey, the arbok inflates its hood and makes eerie hissing sounds. Seeing the pattern a la "terrible muzzle" on the belly of the arbok, the victim is frightened and freezes in horror, and the snake covers the prey and crushes, or finishes off with a poisonous bite. Arbok is so strong that it can crush a steel tank. Able to attack with electric needles. Also, the arbok can burn through obstacles with acid, which allows it to wade even in impassable places. Possesses powerful attacks such as Hyper Beam, Stomach Juice and Giga Impulse. Arbok's arsenal of attacks is extremely diverse, despite the fact that it belongs only to the poisonous type. As soon as Erbok joins the battle, the enemy begins to panic and attacks only half-strength. The arbok has a special property, thanks to which it has a 30% chance to heal on its own from poisoning, burns, paralysis and frostbite.
