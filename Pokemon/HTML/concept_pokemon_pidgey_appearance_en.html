<h2>Appearance</h2>
Pidgey resembles a small, slightly plump bird. Mostly dark brown, only the throat and belly of a lighter shade. The tips of the wings are cream colored. Feet and beak pinkish gray. The claws are rather sharp on the legs. Its plumage is rather plain-looking, especially in comparison with evolutions. Around the eyes there are black spots; on the top of the head there is a small tuft of brown and cream feathers. The piji is reminiscent of other small flying type Pokémon, such as starly, tayllow, spiro and pidav. However, due to the fact that these Pokémon (with the exception of Spiro) are usually unique to the region, it is likely that they are the result of divergent evolution.
