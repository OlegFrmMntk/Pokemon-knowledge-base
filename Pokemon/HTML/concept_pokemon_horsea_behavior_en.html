<h2>Behavior</h2>
If they feel trouble, they spit ink at the adversary. If the adversary is too strong, the Horsy tries to swim away as soon as possible. When they find a safe place, you can see how they playfully tangled their tails together. If the current in the ocean is too strong, the horsy can catch its tail on a ledge of a rock or coral as an anchor, so as not to be carried away by the current. He also has the ability to spit ink to avoid any potential danger.
