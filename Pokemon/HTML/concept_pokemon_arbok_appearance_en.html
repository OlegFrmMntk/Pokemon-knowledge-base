<h2>Appearance</h2>
Arbok is a purple Cobra Pokemon. On the belly there are bizarre patterns in the form of eyes and mouth. They serve as a warning to humans and other Pokémon that erbok is poisonous. Six variations of patterns have been found, and these vary depending on the Pokémon's habitat. Compared to the previous evolution, the arbok has become shorter, but much stronger. Gone is the rattle at the end of the tail.
