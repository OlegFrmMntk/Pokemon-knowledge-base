<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Like its evolution, Charizard is fluent in fire attacks. And the fact that he evolved from a fire starter gives him the opportunity to learn the explosive flame attack. He can also strike with claws and tail, and he has flying type attacks. In addition, he can learn dragon-type attacks such as Dragon Claw, Dragon Breath, Dragon Fury, and Dragon Pulse. Also in his arsenal are attacks like “shadow claw” and “smoke screen”, and since he is the final evolution, he can use such powerful attacks as “hyper-ray” and “giga-momentum”. Charizard has the same statistics as Typhlosn. Charizard, Infernaip and Typhlosna have the highest stats among start-ups, with the exception of Swampert, who has 1 unit higher. Charizard is the only non-dragon type Pokémon that can learn the Dragon Claw attack by leveling up. Due to the presence of a tail, claws and wings, Charizard is the only Pokémon (with the exception of Smörgl and Muw) that can learn all three attacks: the Iron Tail, the Metal Claw, and the Steel Wing. Charizard, Smurgl, Mew and Flygon are the only Pokémon that can learn both "digging" and "flying."
