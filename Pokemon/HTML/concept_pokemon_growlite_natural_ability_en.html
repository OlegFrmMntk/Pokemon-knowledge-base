<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Growlites actively attack in battle. They act well in a team. They recognize the owner by his voice. His super-flair allows Growlith to memorize absolutely any smell, be it an enemy or a lost person or a Pokemon. He uses his sense of smell to determine someone else's mood.

Growlites refrain from attacking if they see that their opponent has surrendered. In a collective fight, the opponent is surrounded, depriving him of the opportunity to escape. With close attacks, they wield fangs, less often claws. They can also use a fiery stream. With their loud voices, Growlites can stun or discourage opponents. Usually growls and angry eyes are enough to intimidate.
