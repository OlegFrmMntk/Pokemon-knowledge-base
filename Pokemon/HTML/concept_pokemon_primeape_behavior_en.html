<h2>Behavior</h2>
Like its pre-evolution, it is rarely calm, quickly enraged. He has a sensitive dream, if you wake him up, he will chase after you even in a drowsy state. But worst of all, if you give a primitive a real reason for anger, then it will chase you even to the end of the world and will not calm down until it is well-rounded. And it is useless to resist - because of this, the Primeape will only get even more angry.
