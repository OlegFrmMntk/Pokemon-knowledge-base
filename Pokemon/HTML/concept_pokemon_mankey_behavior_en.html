<h2>Behavior</h2>
Very cute and kind Pokemon. If you donâ€™t make him angry. But if you give even the slightest excuse, semolina will become so furious that you will forever regret what you have done. Mankeys will tear and throw, beat everyone and everything: friends and enemies, and will not calm down for a long time. So, if you notice that the manki is slightly shaking, and his breathing has become heavy, run as fast as you can while there is still a meager chance to escape.
