<h2>Behavior</h2>
This is a very calm and balanced pokemon. He is also unusually smart. Although the Knights are capable of deceit and meanness, they will never do it without good reason. Despite the usual composure of a Pokemon, it can easily be pissed off, then the offender does not say hello, because the Nailtails are not too lazy to use their fiery and psychic abilities. Ninetales is a very vengeful Pokemon, he will never forget the insult. They say that if you touch his tail, a curse awaits you for 1000 years, just as much as the Nailtails grew one tail. Knights' long life sometimes plays a trick on him. Knights is very accustomed to his coach, but, ultimately, he has to survive the death of the owner, and then Knights can still miss his trainer for hundreds of years.
