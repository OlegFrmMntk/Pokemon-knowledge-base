<h2>Behavior</h2>
A very secretive Pokemon. Unlike his brothers in the trio, Articuno will not voluntarily arrange a struggle for territory and increase the influence of his element. He has a calmer character. But if a collision with other birds is inevitable, by nature, Articuno will come into confrontation with forces hostile to him.

Due to its habitat, where it is difficult for people to get, Articuno is very poorly understood. Many even think that Articuno is nothing more than a myth.

Although Galarsky Artikuno has a cold and soulless character, he has an exquisite manner of movement. To show his greatness, he does not use his wings to stay in the air.
