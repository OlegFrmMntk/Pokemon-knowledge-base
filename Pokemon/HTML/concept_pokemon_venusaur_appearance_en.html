<h2>Appearance</h2>
The Venusaur is much larger, heavier and slower relative to its pre-evolution. The bud on its back blossomed into a huge red flower with six wide petals, covered with white dots. The stem of the flower resembles the trunk of a palm tree. The spots present on the pre-evolution of the venusaur turned into warts. In addition, the inside of the ears turned red. It feeds mainly on photosynthesis. A flower on his back generates a lot of energy. Therefore, venusaurs prefer to simply stand in the sun, doing nothing. This also determines their love of open and sunny places. It is not known whether the venusaur generally needs to eat anything else. The color of the flower becomes brighter if the Pokemon receives enough sunlight and nutrients. After the rain, the aroma of his flower becomes stronger. The number of petals of a Venusaur flower is constantly changing, then there are five, then six. There are always six in the anime. The color of the venusaur also constantly changes from light blue to bright green. A seed emerges from the flower of a female Venusaur. Venusaur is the only 1st generation starter with differences between males and females. In addition, the venusaur is generally the first Pokémon in the national Pokédex, with differences between the sexes. Like Mega Venusaur, the flower on its back becomes larger and two smaller pink flowers bloom, one on the forehead and one on the back. The weight of the flower makes its paws and back become stronger to support it. Around the flower, additional leaves grow with tree stems that are supported by the vine. Mega Venusaur also develops dark marks on the forehead under a new flower.
