<h2>Appearance</h2>
Ho-Oh looks like a large bird with a long neck. On its head is a crest, consisting of four feathers with curved ends, resembling a crown, which once again proves that Ho-Oh is very powerful. There is a black rim on my eyes. There is a green ring on the center of the neck. The wings consist of two rows: in the first, long red feathers with flat ends, and the second row consists of white feathers with green ends. Paws are blue-purple in color, consisting, like many birds, of four fingers: three in front and one behind. The tail is formed from a single row of long golden feathers.
