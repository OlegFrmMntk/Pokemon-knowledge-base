<h2>Behavior</h2>
The Charizard is quite heavy. He is very proud, self-confident and stubborn. Charizard is always looking for an equal opponent to practice and increase his strength. He does not like to spend time fighting with weaker Pok√©mon. When Charizard is angry, the flame on his tail becomes blue and white. His fiery breath is able to melt boulders, massive glaciers and, as you know, causes forest fires, so the charizard needs an experienced owner who can keep his Pokemon under control. Sometimes Charizard expresses his love, blowing fire at the trainer.
