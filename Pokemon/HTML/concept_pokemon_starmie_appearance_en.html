<h2>Appearance</h2>
Interestingly, the back of this Pokemon was depicted in several different ways. In the anime, the oldies look like two starfish merged together, while in more modern games the back half was shown completely independently of the front half of the Pokemon. Many fans tend to find the description in the anime more realistic. The starmi core shimmers with all the colors of the rainbow, which gives it a resemblance to a gem.
