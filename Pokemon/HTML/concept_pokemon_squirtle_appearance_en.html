<h2>Appearance</h2>
Squirtle is a small turtle with blue skin. He has a round brown carapace with a yellow abdomen. The shell has hexagonal patterns. On the side, the shell has a white trim. Squirtle has four legs of the same length. He moves on two rear. Although it is a water pokemon, it feels great on land and away from water. At Squirtle's birth, it has a soft shell that gradually begins to harden. As a result, the carapace becomes strong enough to become a good defense for the owner. His tail is longer than that of real turtles, with his help he makes attacks like tail-whip and water tail. Squirtle is the first water-type pokemon in National Dex. Squirtles have no particular difference between the sexes. According to statistics, Squirtle is the slowest of all Kanto start-ups.
