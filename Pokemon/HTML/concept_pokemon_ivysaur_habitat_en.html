<h2>Habitat</h2>
The natural habitat of the Ivysaur is the plains, always open to sunlight and with access to water. But they can also be found in the forests and in the jungle. This is a rare species, as many have already been caught. Mostly found in Kanto. When its flower is about to bloom, a strong, sweet smell appears. In preparation for evolution, the Ivysaur lies in the sun. Thanks to the plant, Ivysaur can photosynthesize.
