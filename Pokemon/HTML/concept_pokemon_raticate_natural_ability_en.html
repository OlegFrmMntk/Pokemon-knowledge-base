<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Raticate's main weapon is its teeth. When danger approaches, the raticate stands on its hind legs and begins to snap its huge incisors to intimidate the enemy. These incisors are so strong that Raticate can gnaw through a concrete wall. Many buildings collapsed due to ratikates, which damaged the foundation.
