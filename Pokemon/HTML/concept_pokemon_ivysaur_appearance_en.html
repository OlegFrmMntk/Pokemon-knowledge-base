<h2>Appearance</h2>
Ivysaur, like its pre-evolution bulbasaur, resembles a frog or dinosaur, although the root of “saur” suggests that the authors assumed it was a reptile. After evolution from a bulbasaur, small fangs, more pronounced ears grow at the Ivysaur. The skin of the Ivysaur has a bluish tint, like that of a bulbasaur. However, the most notable difference in the appearance of the Ivysaur is the pink bud growing with the leaves. This bud emerged from a bulb on the back. The flower bud is heavy, to the point where the hind legs of the Ivysaur become strong and strong to support it. But now the Ivysaur cannot stand on its hind legs, the bud puts too much pressure on it to the ground (the strange thing is that despite this, on the first sprites of the Ivysaur it stands on its hind legs). When the bud starts to produce a sweet aroma, it is a signal that it will soon blossom. There are no special differences in appearance between males and females. Like the bulbasaur, the Ivysaur can go without food for a long time due to its ability to photosynthesis.
