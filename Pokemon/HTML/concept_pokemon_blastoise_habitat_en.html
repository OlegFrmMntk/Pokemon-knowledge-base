<h2>Habitat</h2>
Blastoises can be found on the shores of islands near the ocean, but most often they settle on the shores of ponds and lakes. Most of them are located in the Kanto region. It is rare in nature. Basically, all Blastoises evolve from tamed Squirts, which were given to novice trainers in Kanto as start-ups.
