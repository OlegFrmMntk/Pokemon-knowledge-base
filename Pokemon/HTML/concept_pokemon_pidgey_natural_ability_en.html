<h2>Natural ability</h2>
The small size of the pidgey allows them to easily hide in tall grass, where they usually find small insects. Pidgey feed mainly on veedle, caterpie, shipworms and other small insect pokemon. To scare potential victims in the tall grass, the pidgey quickly flap their wings. This maneuver also serves to defend against enemies. If it was discovered, it blows a cloud of dust into the air with its blows, which allows it to hide unnoticed. This method can also be used for battles. Although the pidgey do not like fights at all. However, they show amazing rage if they are driven into a corner. Pig has an extremely developed sense of coordination, as well as an instinct for direction and homing. Pidgey can find their nest even when they are far from their usual surroundings. Because of this, they are often used to send letters. The legs of the pidgey allow him not only to walk perfectly on the ground, but also to fish. The hidden property is Big Pecks.
