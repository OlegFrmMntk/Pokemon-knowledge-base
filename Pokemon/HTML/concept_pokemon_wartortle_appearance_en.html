<h2>Appearance</h2>
Wartortle is an indigo turtle with large fluffy ears and a tail. He walks on two legs, has a brown shell. Small fangs protrude from the mouth. On hands three sharp claws. The iris is brown. At high speeds, the balancer moves his unusual furry ears and tail to balance. They stick out even when the warthirl hid in a shell. Wartortle uses a tail to hold air to stay under water for a long time. In older wartortlles, algae grow on the shell, and the color of the fur on the tail changes.
