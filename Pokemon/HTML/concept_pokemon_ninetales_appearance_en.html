<h2>Appearance</h2>
Ninetales is a fiery Pok√©mon that looks like a fox with nine tails, which explains its name. Mostly covered with smooth, luxurious golden white hair, and the tips of its nine tails are orange. On the top of the head is a large crest, similar to the crest of Vulpix, but much more naughty and sticking out. He has ominous red eyes that give him the ability to mentally control the minds of people and Pokemon. Knights' ears are fox-pointed, three-fingered paws have no visible claws.
