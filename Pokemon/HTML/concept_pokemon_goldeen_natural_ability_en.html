<h2>Natural ability</h2>
Goldeen may have the Quick Swim ability or the Water Curtain ability. "Quick Swim" increases Goldeen's speed when it rains. The "Water Curtain" prevents the burning of Goldeen .. Despite the appearance, the horn is an extremely powerful horn. If we talk about the series, it was used “Attack (blow) with a horn”, “Swipe the tail”, which gave Goldeen a little fly up over the water in one battle.
