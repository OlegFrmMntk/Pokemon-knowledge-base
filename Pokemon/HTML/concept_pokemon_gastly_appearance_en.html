<h2>Appearance</h2>
Gastly has the shape of a black ball. There is a version that Gastly's body is 95% gas and 5% souls of dead people. He has large eyes and a mouth, from which two fangs protrude.
Due to the presence of a body made of gas, Gastly is able to slide to any place he wants. However, Gastly's body will shrink when exposed to strong winds. He can also make himself nearly invisible and get close to enemies unnoticed, and can sweep specified enemies, regardless of their size.
