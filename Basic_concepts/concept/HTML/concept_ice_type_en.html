<h1>Ice type</h1>
The ice type is considered the worst in terms of protection. He only resists attacks of his own type and is weak against the four other types. There are few pure ice Pokémon, so the second types can take away the weaknesses of this type, but this does not change much. But in the attacking sense, the ice type is more than good. Only two Pokémon have double protection against ice type attacks - these are empoleon and chitran. And there are many Pokémon with a double weakness for ice attacks, especially among strong dragons, because most dragons have a second flying type. In the Contests, ice attacks are almost all of the Beautiful type and only some of the Cool. By the way, cool ice type attacks appeared only in the fourth generation, that is, up to the third generation, all ice attacks were Beautiful.
