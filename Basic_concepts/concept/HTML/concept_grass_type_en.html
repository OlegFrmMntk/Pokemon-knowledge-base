<h1>Grass type</h1>
Although grassy attacks are effective against aquatic, aquatic Pokémon can learn ice-type attacks that are dangerous to grassy Pokémon, so it can lose against aquatic Pokémon. A lot of insect and flying pokemon types. Many earthen pokémon are half poisonous. All this reduces the effectiveness of the herbal type. But grass pokémon have many status attacks, for example, they can poison an enemy or paralyze him. It is also possible attacks that will act on opponents, which only then will replace the retired or recalled. In the case of defense: almost every electric pokemon can learn the insect type Beam attack. And against the fiery Pokemon in grass there is practically no chance. In general, grassy Pokemon is not the best choice, because its advantages are not unique, it can be replaced with another type, but it has many weaknesses. And the herbal type is paired with all the types against which it is super effective, which again reduces its importance. In competitions, grass-type attacks are mainly smart, but in this regard, grass attacks are diverse.
