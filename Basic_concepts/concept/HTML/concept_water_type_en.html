<h1>Water type</h1>
When it comes to protection, the water type has advantages like no other. All water-type Pokémon (except magikarp) can learn ice-type attacks that are super effective against grass (as for magikarp, it generally has only one “Bounce” attack, it is flying type, that is, it is also super effective against grass (it would be more accurate if if she could do damage)). The only serious problem for water pokemon is electric attacks, the water one does not have protection from them. But here you can contrast the Pokémon with half earthen and stone types, such as kvaksayr, svampert, corsola and gastrodon, they have immunity to attacks of the electric type, but their weakness to attacks of the grass type intensifies. There are only 5 Pokémon with double resistance against water type attacks, and they are all also water. Also the water type is good at attacking. His ice attacks successfully cope with dragon and grass pokemon types. In addition, water pokemon is simply indispensable when traveling in caves, because its attacks are super effective against earth and stone pokemon, and its resistance is high. But there are still many stone / earth and earth / stone pokemon types, their water type clicks like nuts. Without water Pokemon it is almost impossible to travel, because almost only this type can learn the abilities "Surf", "Waterfall", "Whirlpool" and "Dive".
