<h1>Rock type</h1>
Stone type attacks are super effective against insect, fire, flying and ice type Pokemon. Half the damage of a stone type attack is inflicted on combat, earth, and steel type Pokémon. In terms of protection, the stone type is not the best choice. Although he has high Defense rates, he is weak against the fighting and earth type of Pokémon, whose main attacks are physical. In addition, he has weak Special indicators. Defense, but the stone type is weak against the grass and water types with their special attacks, which are very common. It is also known that the stone type is often combined with others, which further increase its weaknesses. For example, stone / steel takes four times more damage from combat and earth type attacks. Stone / water and stone / earthy receive quadruple damage from grass attacks, and stone / earthy also from water attacks. The low speed of stone Pokémon also does not improve their position. Resistance against fire attacks is now not so useful, because from the 4th generation many fire Pokémon received grass type attacks. Therefore, stone Pokemon is quite easy to defeat, but it is still useful for its stamina against attacks of the normal, fiery and flying types. But in the attacking sense, the stone type is one of the best. Only three types resist stone-type attacks, but two of them have low Defense indicators, and, most importantly, are rare. There are only two Pokémon with double protection from stone attacks, namely Lucario and the stylix. Its power is useful against the common insect pokemon and flying types, which are also often paired. Fire and ice Pokémon are not so common, but rarely what types can cause them significant damage, and this is a great advantage of the stone type. Among the competitive types, stone attacks, for the most part, are of the Strong type, but there are all others except Milo.
