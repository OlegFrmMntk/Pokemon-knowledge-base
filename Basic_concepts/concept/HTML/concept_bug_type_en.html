<h1>Bug type</h1>
Along with flying and normal Pokémon, insects are one of the first wild Pokémon that come across to the trainer on his way. One of their advantages is that they most often evolve at a relatively low level. The stats of different insects are significantly different, and attacks of this type can also powerfully attack and impose various statuses. In an attack, insect attacks are practically unprofitable. After all, they are ineffective against six types at once. But they are convenient because of the strength against the psychic and dark Pokémon that they like to include in the trainer's team. But with grassy Pokémon there is a problem, many of them are half poisonous, and, therefore, insect attacks are not so terrible for them. And there are problems in the defense, because the Defense itself is quite low. To make matters worse, there are so many flying Pokémon. Although insects are well opposed to two powerful types: war and earth, both of these types can learn stone type attacks and here is another weakness of insects.
