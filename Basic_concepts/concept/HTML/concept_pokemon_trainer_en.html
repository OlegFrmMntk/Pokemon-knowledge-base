<h1>Pokemon Trainer</h1>
A man who catches, trains, cares and fights with Pokemon. Most people in the famous Pokemon world are trainers and they have a common goal: to be the best Pokemon trainers, a prestigious title that can be obtained only by defeating the Elite Four and becoming the Pokemon Champion. Few, however, succeed in this goal, except for Ash Ketchum, the protagonist of anime and films who never gives up on his dream. He travels the world of Pokémon on a mission to catch each individual Pokémon and add it to his Pokedex. Next to him is always his reliable Pokemon-electric mouse, Pikachu.
