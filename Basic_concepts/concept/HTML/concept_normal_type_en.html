<h1>Normal type</h1>
The Normal type is rather weak in attack, attacks of this type inflict half the damage to stone and steel Pokémon. Normal attacks are useless against the ghost type. Normal attacks are not super-efficient. Normal-type Pokémon take twice as much damage from combat-type attacks, and are fully protected from phantom attacks.
