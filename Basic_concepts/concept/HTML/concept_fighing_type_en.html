<h1>Fighing type</h1>
The fighing type is one of the strongest. It is effective immediately against five types, and second only to three. In a protective sense, there are pros and cons. Its resistance to attacks of the dark and stone types is very important. But a big minus is its weakness against the common flying Pokemon. And in the battle with the psychics, the combat type has practically no chance at all, because combat Pokémon have very low Special Protection. But in an attacking sense, fighting attacks are few equal. The attack of fighting Pokemon is very high. This is the only type that is super effective versus normal. And few types can do so much damage to powerful stone and steel Pokémon. It is useless against ghostly Pokemon, but this can be fixed with the help of the attacks "Foresight" or "Odor Sleuth", as well as the property "Scrappy".
