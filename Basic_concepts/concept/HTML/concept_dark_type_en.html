<h1>Dark type</h1>
The dark type appeared only from the second generation. That is, it is clear that in the first generation there were no dark Pokemon. In all respects, the dark is a rather mediocre type. Only his attack is pretty decent, which is funny, given that the dark type belongs to a special and not a physical group. But with protection, it is even worse, it has very low indicators (only Ambreon, Spiritomb, Drapion and Tyranitar are exceptions. Pok√©mon of the dark / ghost type are considered to be one of the best in terms of protection, because they have immunity from three other types, and there is no type that would do them double damage, one of the best aspects of the dark type is immunity to powerful psychic attacks.
