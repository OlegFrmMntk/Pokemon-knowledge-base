<h1>Ghost type</h1>
In combination with the dark type, the ghostly gives the Pok√©mon with a weakness only to attacks of the magic type. This can be noted in Sable and Spiritomb. Although attacks like "Foresight" and "Odor Sleuth" can take away the advantages of the dark type. The phantom type is the only one that has more than one immunity. There are ghosts with three immunities at once, for example, Driflun and Drifblim to normal, combat and earthen, as well as Sable and Spiritomb to normal, combat and mental. Only ghosts and dragons can do double damage on their own.
