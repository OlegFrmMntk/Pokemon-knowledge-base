<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_ability">Ability</sc_element></b> - this is the game mechanics presented in the third generation, which provides a passive effect in battle or in the world. Pokemon can have only one ability. Until the sixth generation, the ability could not be changed after receiving the Pokemon, with the exception of evolution, where the new ability is determined by the previous ability, and a change in shape. Not every ability is useful; some will interfere with the user.
