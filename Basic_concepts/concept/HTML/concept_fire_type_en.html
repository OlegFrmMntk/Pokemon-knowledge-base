<h1>Fire type</h1>
The fire type has protection against 5 other types, which puts it in second place in this amount. The first is a steel type that has resistance against 11 types. The fire type has its advantages and disadvantages. The fiery type is very weak against attacks of the earth type, stone and water. And resistance against fire attacks is rarely useful. A successful battle with the fire type is a quick battle, since the fire type has low Defense indicators, but high Speed ​​and Attack. So either the fiery type quickly deals with the enemy, or, most likely, loses. All three types that are effective against Fiery are weak against grass type attacks. In favor of the fire type, we can say that it holds well against 5 types, including the fire type, and, in addition, it does not fear the status of a burn. And almost all fiery Pokémon can learn the powerful Sunbeam attack, which works great against types that fire attacks cannot handle. Fire is an excellent attacking tool. It is super-effective against steel type, which is very important, since regular physical attacks against steel type are practically useless. Fire attacks are very powerful, half of them have a power of 100 or more, and 11 of 16 have a power of at least 80. Until the fifth generation, all fire-type Pokémon had a weakness against the water type, but with the advent of Reshiram, which is half dragon type, it can be call the only fire-type Pokemon without weakness against water.
