<h1>Electric type</h1>
In battle, electric type Pokémon are good at attack and defense. They are valued for their strength against the common flying and water type Pokémon. And while grassy attacks also do pretty well with aquatic ones, aquatic ones can learn ice-type attacks, which reduces the effectiveness of grassy Pokémon and increases the value of electric ones. But the big problem for electric Pokémon are the earth ones, to which electric attacks do no harm. In defense, electric type Pokémon do well because they are weak only against earth attacks and are resistant immediately to three types. But here we must take into account the fact that earth attacks are very common and can be a big problem. The exception is Pokemon such as Zapdos and Magneson. Zapdos is half flying type, and, therefore, is completely protected from earth attacks. And Magneson resists attacks of 12 types at once, against 1 type he is completely protected, and although he has double weakness, it can be avoided with the help of Magnet Rise attack. By type of Competition, Electric attacks of the Cool type are more common, but there is no Strong among them.
