<h1>Ground type</h1>
In terms of protection, the earthen type is not the best choice. He is weak against the often encountered attacks of the ice, grass and water types. But on the other hand, he resists attacks of the poisonous type and stone - this is a big plus. And the fact that earth pokemons are completely protected from attacks of the electric type highly raises their importance, because few types resist electricity. But paralyzing earth pokemon can still. But in an attacking sense, the earthen type is very useful, both icy and combat. It is effective immediately against five types. This is the only type of super-efficient against electric Pokemon, and only three are effective against the steel type: fiery, combat and earthly. A big minus of the earth type is that it is absolutely useless against the common flying type and Pokemon with the Levitation property. In addition, it is bad that there are very few earth attacks. According to the types of competitions, they are mainly of the Strong type. There are no beautiful earth-type attacks.
