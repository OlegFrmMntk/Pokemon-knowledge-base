<h1>Flying type</h1>
The flying type has a rather low Defense, which makes them vulnerable to many attacks. But they have pretty high Attack and Speed. Flying type Pokémon are absolutely immune to earth attacks, in addition, these Pokémon are protected from combat type attacks. But the ability to avoid an earth-type attack is not so useful, because many earth pokemons are also half-stone in addition. Many flying type Pokémon can learn the Roost attack, thanks to which they restore health. In terms of attack, the flying type is also not very strong, but its strength against combat Pokémon is very valuable, because the combat type is weak only against two types of attacks: flying and psychic. And mental type Pokémon are not universal in battle. Also, flying type Pokémon can be trained in a powerful Fly attack, thanks to which you can quickly move around the region.
