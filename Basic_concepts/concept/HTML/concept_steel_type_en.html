<h1>Steel type</h1>
The steel type is considered to be the best type of defense, since 11 of the 17 types of attacks cause steel Pokémon half the damage, but this advantage is not in Pokémon, which belong to some type other than steel, and most of them (Pokémon are pure steel type only six). Invulnerability to poisonous attacks can give a serious advantage, since Pokémon cannot be poisoned. They can withstand a large number of attacks, as they have very high defense indicators, but their special protection is low and they are all weak against the fairly common fire, battle and earth types.
