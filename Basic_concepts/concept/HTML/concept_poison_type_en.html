<h1>Poison type</h1>
In a protective sense, the poisonous type is considered one of the best in the game. First of all, because they are not afraid of status attacks, and they can resist many common attacks. The weakness to earth attacks is easily overcome, because many poisonous Pokémon are half grass or insect types, and there are also flying like a tooth and levitating, like coffing, which earth attacks are not terrible at all. But in the attacking sense there are problems. Poisonous attacks are valued for their status effects, it’s not for nothing that Koga describes poisonous Pokémon in three words: “entangle, put to sleep, poison”. But the poisonous type is effective only against the grassy type, the magic type, which does not make it especially popular among trainers, especially considering the fact that many grassy Pokemon are themselves half-poisonous. In addition, there are many other types effective against herbal. The poisonous type is not very effective against the four types, and is also useless against the steel type.
