<b>Evolution</b> - this is a special process that happens with Pokemon, changing it physically and sometimes spiritually. Some compare this process with growing up, but it is better to draw a connection with the development of the butterfly. First it is a caterpillar, then a chrysalis, and finally a butterfly. It seems to be one and the same creature, but each of its forms is radically different from the previous one (an eternally chewing caterpillar, a motionless chrysalis and a fluttering butterfly). They are connected only by a chain of evolution. Also, in Pokemon, during evolution, it not only becomes larger, but significantly changes in appearance and acquires new abilities. In addition, sometimes after evolution, a Pokemon changes its character and attitude towards others, for better or worse - depends on the type of Pokemon.
