This fight is on TV watched by <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash Ketchum</sc_element>. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> is a young, but energetic, determined and full of enthusiasm and determination boy who lives in a town called Alabastia (also known as <sc_element sys_idtf="pallet_town">Pallet Town</sc_element>). He turns 10 and finally gets the right to fulfill his main dream, the dream of many children - to become a Pokemon <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">trainer</sc_element>. To do this, he must come to the laboratory to <sc_element sys_idtf="Professor_Oak">Professor Oak</sc_element> - one of the world's most famous authorities in the study of <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element>. In <sc_element sys_idtf="pallet_town">Pallet Town</sc_element>, <sc_element sys_idtf="Professor_Oak">Professor Oak</sc_element> gives budding trainers one of three <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> to choose from: <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_charmander">Charmander</sc_element>, <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_squirtle">Squirtle</sc_element>, or <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</sc_element>. On the eve of this momentous day, <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element>, overwhelmed with emotions, cannot fall asleep, and when he falls asleep, he has a restless dream about how he chooses different <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> and begins his path as a <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">trainer</sc_element>. He uses his alarm clock as a pokeball and as a result he wakes up the moment of distributing <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> to novice <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">trainers</sc_element> and, coming to the laboratory, meets with the grandson of <sc_element sys_idtf="Professor_Oak">Professor Oak</sc_element> - <sc_element sys_idtf="Garry_Oak">Garry</sc_element>, who has already got the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> and who has got fans in the form of pretty girls. Going on his way, <sc_element sys_idtf="Garry_Oak">Garry</sc_element> promises to glorify <sc_element sys_idtf="pallet_town">Pallet Town</sc_element> and become the greatest <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> master in the world. <sc_element sys_idtf="Professor_Oak">Professor Oak</sc_element> rebukes <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> for oversleeping the moment he has been waiting for all his life, and offers him a choice of several Pokeballs, which turn out to be empty, since the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> have already been taken by other <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">traines</sc_element> who did not sleep this moment. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> asks the professor to give him at least some <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element>, and he invites him to take another Pokeball. This <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> turns out to be <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element>, in the future <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash's</sc_element> most faithful friend and comrade, with him they will go through all the difficulties on their way. <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> does not want to return to his pokeball, he does not recognize <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> as a <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">trainer</sc_element> and hits him with a discharge of electricity, and then the escorts, whom <sc_element sys_idtf="Delia_Ketchum">Ash's mother</sc_element> gathered. Walking through the woods, <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> stumbles upon <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_rattata">Rattata</sc_element> first, and then <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pidgey">Pidgey</sc_element>, one of the best <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> for a beginner <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">trainer</sc_element>. <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> refuses to help <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> and the boy decides to act on his own, as a result, he not only did not catch the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pidgey">Pidgey</sc_element> or <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_rattata">Rattata</sc_element>, but also angered the whole flock of <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_spearow">Spearow</sc_element>, who flew after them all the way, until the very end of the series (by the way, he will still meet this flock at the beginning second season). Escaping from them, <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> jumps off the cliff into the lake and falls for the bait of a girl named <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element>, from this moment we meet another <sc_element sys_idtf="nrel_anime_character">main character of the anime</sc_element>. <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> points out to <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> where the <sc_element sys_idtf="pokemon_center">Pokemon Center</sc_element> is so that the injured <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> can be cured there. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element>, seeing that the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_spearow">Spearow</sc_element> is close, steals <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty's</sc_element> bike and leaves, promising to return it someday. A thunderstorm starts, it rains, and lightnings appear in the sky. <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_spearow">Spearow</sc_element> overtakes <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> and they break their bike and fall. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element>, wanting to save <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element>, forces him to return to the Poké Ball, and then shields him with his body from <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_spearow">Spearow</sc_element>. <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element>, surprised by <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash's</sc_element> behavior, saves both of them by striking a flock of <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_spearow">Spearows</sc_element> with lightning, and they fly away. From that moment on, <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> and <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> became best friends. When <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> wakes up, he sees that the storm has calmed down, and a rainbow is lit up in the sky, towards which a <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> is flying, on which the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokedex">pokedex</sc_element> does not give any information. Later it turns out that it was the legendary <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_ho_oh">Ho-oh</sc_element>, and a person who sees him will have great happiness in life. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element>, leaving the broken bike, carries the exhausted <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachu</sc_element> to the <sc_element sys_idtf="pokemon_center">Pokemon Center</sc_element>, while <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> tries to catch up with <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> with a desire to return the money for the broken bike.
