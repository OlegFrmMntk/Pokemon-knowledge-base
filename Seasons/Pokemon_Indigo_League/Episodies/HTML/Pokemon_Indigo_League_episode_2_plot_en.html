<h1>Pokemon: Indigo League Series 2</h1>
<sc_element sys_idtf = "Officer_Jenny"> Officer Jenny </sc_element> has been informed of a gang in Viridian stealing <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_type"> Pokémon </sc_element>, and she urges residents to be alert and alert to strangers. Suddenly she notices <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> running down the road with a wounded Pikachu in his arms. Jenny stops Ash to find out where he got this Pokemon. Ash is trying to prove that this <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> is his Pokemon, but he doesn't know anything about the ID. Jenny notices Ash's Pokedex in his pocket and finds the ID in Ash's. She then decides to take Ash to the Pokémon Center. The motorbike driving away is covered with a wave of dust <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element>, carrying a broken bike on her shoulders. Even more annoyed, she runs after them. With a fishing rod, James removes the wanted poster from the board near the post. Team R - the very gang Jenny heard about - decides to steal Pokémon from the Pokémon Center.

Jenny rides her motorcycle into the lobby of the Pokémon Center. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Sister_Joy"> Sister Joy </sc_element>, the head of the center, reminds Jenny that the vehicles are being parked. In response, she says that Pikachu needs help and Ash asks for help. Seeing Pikachu, Sister Joy gives the command to launch a stretcher for electric Pokémon and two Chansey bring them, Joy puts Pikachu on the stretcher and tells Ash that everything will be fine, after which he gives Chancy the order to take Pikachu to the operating room for intensive care. Jenny introduces Ash as the new Pokémon Trainer. Ash asks sister Joy what he can do for Pikachu, Joy tells Ash that if he wants to become a good Pokemon trainer, he must be more responsible and advises against letting his Pokemon fight if they are in bad shape. Ash tries to explain what happened, but Joy cuts it off, saying "what's happened is gone." Ash asks what he should do, but Joy calms him down by telling him that she will take care of everything. Joy praises Jenny for quickly bringing Ash and his Pikachu, Jenny says it's her duty, and then returns to the post. Joy begins resuscitating Pikachu, while Ash remains in the waiting room.

After a few hours of waiting, Ash decides to call home. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Delia Ketchum"> Delia Ketchum </sc_element>, Ash's mom, answers the call and when she hears her son, she is immediately delighted and asks if he is all right and where he is now. Ash tells his mom that he is in the Pokemon Center in Viridian, Delia tells Ash that just four days after starting his training campaign, she spoke to his father and says that he is very proud of his beloved son, because he grew up and straightened his wings like Spiro. Ash sadly says that he feels like a falling Pidgey, but Delia provokes him more, saying that he must be confident in himself and then he can do whatever he plans, after which she wishes him good luck on his adventure. Right after talking to her mom, Ash notices an engraving of the legendary Pokemon. He examines it and sees a Pokemon similar to the one that flew across the rainbow. Suddenly the phone rings and Ash answers the call. This is Professor Oak calling. Professor Oak tells Ash that three other coaches from Alabastia have already made it to Viridian, and that when his grandson, Gary, said that even if Ash did get to Viridian, without a single Pokemon, the professor bet him a million dollars that Gary wrong. Ash tells the professor about an unusual Pokemon, but he does not believe Ash that he saw the legendary Ho-oh, and then wishes Ash good luck in his adventures and runs away to pick up the pizza he ordered.

Misty walks into the center and shows Ash her bike, which was destroyed by Thunder Shock Pikachu. She angrily tells Ash that he will have to pay for a new bike. Ash tells her that his Pikachu was badly hurt and he cannot think about her bike. Misty becomes sad and after a short moment Sister Joy and the two Chansey bring Pikachu on a stretcher. Sister Joy, happy with the successful treatment, tells Ash that Pikachu will still need to stay at the Pokémon Center in order for him to rest and recover. Ash thanks her sister Joy for her help, Misty also calms down, stating that she will give Ash time before he has to replace her bike.

Jenny reports that Team R's balloon has been spotted over the city. The ball hovers over the center of the Pokémon, and Jesse and James throw the Poké Balls with Ekans and Koffing down. Both Pokémon start to make a mess. Team R enters the center and utters its motto, declaring itself. Ash does not understand them, then Jesse and James command their Pokémon to attack. Ash, Misty, and Joy escape to the Poké Ball storage room. Ekans and Koffing break the wiring and the center is de-energized. Joy calms the guys down and shows them an emergency pikachu generator where a lot of pikachu generate current, then she sends pokeballs to Pewter. Team R Pokemon Burst go into the room and interfere with the transmission of Poke Balls. Ash tries to use Pokémon from Poké Balls, but fails. Misty then tells the R Team that she will teach them a lesson and releases Goldin. Goldin is no more useless than Ash's Pidgey and Rattata. Ash tries to escape with Pikachu, but Team R catches up with him. Pikachu calls many other Pikachu, gets a charge from them, and shocks Team R with an electric shock. Meowth is not hit and goes to Pikachu to grab him. Pikachu asks Ash to help him generate even more electricity. Ash starts pedaling his bike, generating energy for the headlight. Pikachu connects to the headlamp and attacks with an even more powerful electric shock. From the discharge, Koffing explodes and Team R flies into the air, and the center of the Pokémon falls apart. Joy in Viridian receives confirmation from Joy in Pewter that all the Poke Balls have been delivered safely and says that Ash and Misty have already made their way to Pewter.

Misty screams in the Viridian Forest. She pokes with horror somewhere to the side and hides behind Ash. Ash looks in the same direction and sees a Caterpie. Misty asks Ash to do something. Ash removes the Poké Ball from his belt and throws it into the Caterpie.
