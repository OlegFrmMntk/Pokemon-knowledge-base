<h1>Viridian Forest</h1>
The Viridian Forest is a forest in western Kanto that lies between <sc_element sys_idtf="viridian_city">Viridian City</sc_element> and Pewter City in the middle of Route 2. The deep and sprawling forest is considered a natural maze as many people get lost inside. The trees in the forest are so dense that little light penetrates inside, and because of this, the forest is full of <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_bug_type">bug pokemon</sc_element> and <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_flying_type">flying Pok√©mon</sc_element>, which attract Beetle Catchers and other <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">trainers</sc_element>.
