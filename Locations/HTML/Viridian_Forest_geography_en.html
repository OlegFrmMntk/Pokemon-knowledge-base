<h1>Geography</h1>
The Viridian Forest is a deep and vast wooded area that stretches along Route 2, reaching Pewter City in the north and <sc_element sys_idtf="viridian_city">Viridian City</sc_element> in the south, which gives the forest its name. The trees in the area are so dense that it is difficult for light to break through them, making the forest look dark and gloomy. The path leading to each destination winds its way around the dense layers of trees, creating a giant maze that many compare to a natural maze, as many people get lost inside. The entrance to the forest seems light and airy: the trees are not so dense, and the sunlight penetrates perfectly. The trees are tall and the grass looks long and unkempt, while the trees in the distance appear shaded. Due to its dark and shady environment, the Viridian Forest contains a large number of different <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_bug_type">bug pokemon</sc_element>. They are not particularly powerful, but they can cause status conditions such as paralysis and poisoning. From signage and even from other <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_trainer">trainers</sc_element>, it is recommended that trainers purchase status healing items such as Antidote and Anti-Paralysis before entering the forest. <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">Pokemon</sc_element> such as <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_caterpie">Caterpie</sc_element>, Weedle, <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_metapod">Metapod</sc_element> and Kakuna inhabit trees and tall grass, allowing themselves to remain hidden from predators. The Viridian Forest is also one of the places where trainers can look for wild <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pikachu">Pikachus</sc_element> as well as low-level <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_pidgeotto">Pidgeottos</sc_element>, making the forest a very exclusive place to find <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element>. Beetle Catchers who wield insect-type Pok√©mon such as <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_caterpie">Caterpie</sc_element> and Weedl come here in groups from Viridian and Pewter to fight and train.
