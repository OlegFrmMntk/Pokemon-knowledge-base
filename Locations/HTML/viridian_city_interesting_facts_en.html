   <ul>
     <li> There is a song in the anime called Viridian City where we learn about the location of the final Kanto Gim. </li>
     <li> Viridian City is the only first city after Hometown to have a Gym, although it is closed until the player earns seven badges. </li>
     <li> Oddly enough, while the store employee on Route 1 gives the player a potion as a free sample, the store does not sell potions here. This has been fixed in Pokemon Yellow. </li>
     <li> In the Russian voice acting of the anime, the city is also known as Vertania. The reason for this is that some episodes of the first season were dubbed by Polish, not English. </li>
