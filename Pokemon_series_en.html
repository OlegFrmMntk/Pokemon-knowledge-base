<h1>Pokemon (series)</h1>
The plot tells the story of a boy named Ash Ketchum from the city of Pallet Town in the Kanto region, who dreams of becoming a Pokemon Master - the best of the trainers. Together with his friends, people and Pokemon, Ash travels around the regions, defeats the leaders of the stadiums, collects their badges and participates in championships. At the beginning of each series, Ash leaves all the Pok√©mon he caught with Professor Oak, except for his most faithful friend and comrade, Pikachu, and starts from the very beginning. Approximately according to this plan, the main plot of almost all the plot arches takes place. Heroes on the heels are followed by members of Team R - Jesse, James and Meowth, who intend to kidnap Pikachu, but fail over and over again.
