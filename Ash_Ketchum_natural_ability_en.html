<h2>Ability</h2>
Ash has quite a few abilities and skills. First of all, this is his athleticism, despite his young age, as Ash is very athletic and physically capable. In fact, Ash was once even called the Manki Man because of his ability to climb. In addition to climbing, Ash can run fast, swing on vines, carry weights and swim. Ash can also survive Pokémon attacks for a long period of time without taking too much damage, although this depends on the situation. In addition, while Ash is a very talented fighter, he also has some performance skills due to the fact that he participated in several Pokemon competitions, and also watched the performances of May and Dawn, which also competed with him. In addition, he also has good fishing skills. Ash also has some culinary skills, as well as good knowledge about Pokémon, as she spends a lot of time with friends who can cook and have deep knowledge about them.
