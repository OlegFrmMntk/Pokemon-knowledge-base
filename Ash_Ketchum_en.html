<h1>Ash Ketchum</h1>
The main character of the animated series "Pokemon". Over all seasons, Ash makes many friends, some of them become his companions. He is forever 10 years old and his cherished dream is to become the greatest Pokemon Master in the world. The first starting Pokemon that he gets with great difficulty when he turns 10 from Professor Oak - electric Pikachu. Starting his journeys to new regions - Ash sees (sometimes briefly) the legendary Pokémon, who thus “welcome” him in his territory. Thanks to this, Ash is the only character who is familiar with the largest number of legendary Pokémon. Although some residents of the regions where Ash travels have never seen a single legendary Pokemon in their entire lives. So, Ash is really very unique.
